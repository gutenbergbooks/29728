<p><b>Transcriber's Note</b></p>

<p>The original text used a Prescription Take symbol, &#8478;, to indicate
recipe numbers. There are also some characters with a macron or
overline (straight line) above them. You may need to adjust your
font settings for these to display properly.</p>

<p>The many inconsistencies in hyphenation and use of accents and
ligatures have been preserved as printed, with a few exceptions.
Variable and archaic spelling has also been preserved. A full
list of amendments and other notes follow the end of the book.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the recipe and page numbers in the
index are incorrect; however, they have been preserved as
printed. The transcriber has, as far as possible, linked to
the correct place in the text. Where the reference could not be
determined, the numbers remain unlinked.</p>

<h2>EXPLANATION OF TYPESETTING, ABBREVIATIONS, AND SYSTEM OF NUMBERING</h2>


<h3>TEXT AND HEADINGS</h3>

<p>The original ancient text as presented and rendered in the present
translation is printed in capital letters.</p>

<p>Matter in parenthesis () is original. Matter in square brackets [] is
contributed by the translator.</p>

<p>In most of the early originals the headings or titles of the formul&aelig;
are invariably part of the text. In the present translation they are
given both in English and in the Latin used by those originals which
the translator considered most characteristic titles.</p>

<p>They have been set in prominent type as titles over each formula,
whereas in the originals the formul&aelig; of the various chapters run
together, in many instances without distinct separation.</p>


<h3>NUMBERING OF RECIPES</h3>

<p>A system of numbering the recipes has therefore been adopted by the
translator, following the example of Schuch, which does not exist in
the other originals but the numbers in the present translation do not
correspond to those adopted by Schuch for reasons which hereafter
become evident.</p>


<h3>NOTES AND COMMENTS BY THE TRANSLATOR</h3>

<p>The notes, comments and variants added to each recipe by the
translator are printed in upper and lower case and in the same type as
the other contributions by the translator, the Apiciana, the Critical
Review and the Vocabulary and Index.</p>

<p>For the sake of convenience, to facilitate the study of each recipe
and for quick reference the notes follow in each and every case such
ancient recipe as they have reference to.</p>

<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="center"><small>BY</small></p>

<p class="center">FREDERICK STARR<br />
<i>Formerly Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>O translation of Apicius into English has yet been published. The book has
been printed again and again in Latin and has been translated into Italian
and German. It is unnecessary to here give historic details regarding the
work as Mr. Vehling goes fully and admirably into the subject. In 1705 the book
was printed in Latin at London, with notes by Dr. Martinus Lister. It caused
some stir in the England of that time. In a very curious book, The Art of Cookery,
in Imitation of Horace&rsquo;s Art of Poetry, with Some Letters to Dr. Lister and
Others, Dr. Wm. King says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The other curiosity is the admirable piece of C&oelig;lius Apicius, &lsquo;<i>De Opsoniis
et condimentis sive arte coquinaria, Libri decem</i>&rsquo; being ten books of
soups and sauces, and the art of cookery, as it is excellently printed for the
doctor, who in this important affair, is not sufficiently communicative....</p>

<p>&ldquo;I some days ago met with an old acquaintance, of whom I inquired if
he has seen the book concerning soups and sauces? He told me he had, but
that he had but a very slight view of it, the person who was master of it
not being willing to part with so valuable a rarity out of his closet. I desired
him to give me some account of it. He says that it is a very handsome
octavo, for, ever since the days of Ogilvy, good paper and good print, and
fine cuts, make a book become ingenious and brighten up an author
strangely. That there is a copious index; and at the end a catalogue of all
the doctor&rsquo;s works, concerning cockles, English beetles, snails, spiders, that
get up into the air and throw us down cobwebs; a monster vomited up by
a baker and such like; which if carefully perused, would wonderfully
improve us.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>More than two hundred years have passed and we now have an edition of this
curious work in English. And our edition has nothing to lose by comparison with
the old one. For this, too, is a handsome book, with good paper and good print
and fine cuts. And the man who produces it can equally bear comparison with
Dr. Lister and more earlier commentators and editors whom he quotes&mdash;Humelbergius
and Caspar Barthius.</p>

<p>The preparation of such a book is no simple task and requires a rare combination
of qualities. Mr. Vehling possesses this unusual combination. He was
born some forty-five years ago in the small town of Duelken on the German-Dutch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
frontier&mdash;a town proverbial for the dullness of its inhabitants. There
was nothing of dullness about the boy, however, for at the age of fourteen years,
he had already four years study of Latin and one of Greek to his credit. Such
was his record in Latin that his priest teachers attempted to influence him toward
the priesthood. His family, however, had other plans and believing that he had
enough schooling, decided that he should be a cook. As he enjoyed good food,
had a taste for travel and independence, and was inclined to submit to family
direction, he rather willingly entered upon the career planned for him. He
learned the business thoroughly and for six years practiced his art in Germany,
Belgium, France, England and Scandinavia. Wherever he went, he gave his hours
of freedom to reading and study in libraries and museums.</p>

<p>During his first trip through Italy and on a visit to Pompeii he conceived the
idea of depicting some day the table of the Romans and of making the present
translation. He commenced to gather all the necessary material for this work,
which included intensive studies of the ancient arts and languages. Meanwhile,
he continued his hotel work also, quite successfully. At the age of twenty-four
he was assistant manager of the fashionable Hotel Bristol, Vienna.</p>

<p>However, the necessities of existence prevented his giving that time and study
to art, which is necessary if it was to become a real career. In Vienna he found
music, drama, languages, history, literature and gastronomy, and met interesting
people from all parts of the globe. While the years at Vienna were the happiest
of his life, he had a distaste for the &ldquo;superheated, aristocratic and military
atmosphere.&rdquo; It was at that city that he met the man who was responsible for his
coming to America. Were we writing Mr. Vehling&rsquo;s biography, we would have
ample material for a racy and startling narrative. We desire only to indicate the
remarkable preparation for the work before us, which he has had. A Latin
scholar of exceptional promise, a professional cook of pronounced success, and an
artist competent to illustrate his own work! Could such a combination be anticipated?
It is the combination that has made this book possible.</p>

<p>The book has claims even upon our busy and practical generation. Mr. Vehling
has himself stated them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The important addition to our knowledge of the ancients&mdash;for our
popular notions about their table are entirely erroneous and are in need of
revision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The practical value of many of the ancient formul&aelig;&mdash;for &lsquo;In Olde
Things There is Newnesse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The human interest&mdash;because of the amazing mentality and the culinary
ingenuity of the ancients revealed to us from an altogether new angle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The curious novelty and the linguistic difficulty, the philological interest
and the unique nature of the task, requiring unique prerequisites&mdash;all
these factors prompted us to undertake this translation.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>One word as to Mr. Vehling&rsquo;s work in America. He was for five years manager
of catering at the Hotel Pfister in Milwaukee; for two and a half years he
was inspector and instructor of the Canadian Pacific Railway; he was connected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
with some of the leading hotels in New York City, and with the Eppley and the
Van Orman Hotels chains, in executive capacity. He not only has the practical
side of food use and preparation, he is an authority upon the science in his field.
His printed articles on food and cookery have been read with extraordinary interest,
and his lectures upon culinary matters have been well received. It is to be
hoped that both will eventually be published in book form.</p>

<p>There is no financial lure in getting out an English translation of Apicius. It
is a labor of love&mdash;but worth the doing. We have claimed that Mr. Vehling has
exceptional fitness for the task. This will be evident to anyone who reads his
book. An interesting feature of his preparation is the fact that Mr. Vehling has
subjected many of the formul&aelig; to actual test. As Dr. Lister in the old edition
of 1705 increased the value and interest of the work by making additions from
various sources, so our editor of today adds much and interesting matter in his
supplements, notes and illustrations.</p>

<p>It is hardly expected that many will follow Mr. Vehling in testing the Apician
formul&aelig;. Hazlitt in speaking of &ldquo;The Young Cook&rsquo;s Monitor&rdquo; which was printed
in 1683, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Some of the ingredients proposed for sauces seem to our ears rather
prodigious. In one place a contemporary peruser has inserted an ironical
calculation in MS. to the effect that, whereas a cod&rsquo;s head could be bought
for fourpence, the condiments recommended for it were not to be had for
less than nine shillings.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>We shall close with a plagiarism oft repeated. It was a plagiarism as long ago
as 1736, when it was admitted such in the preface of Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Compleat
Housewife&rdquo;:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;It being grown as fashionable for a book now to appear in public without
a preface, as for a lady to appear at a ball without a hoop-petticoat, I
shall conform to the custom for fashion-sake and not through any necessity.
The subject being both common and universal, needs no argument
to introduce it, and being so necessary for the gratification of the appetite,
stands in need of no encomiums to allure persons to the practice of it; since
there are but a few nowadays who love not good eating and drinking....&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Old Apicius and Joseph Dommers Vehling really need no introduction.</p>

<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The present first translation into English of the ancient cookery book
dating back to Imperial Roman times known as the Apicius book is herewith
presented to antiquarians, friends of the Antique as well as to gastronomers,
friends of good cheer.</p>

<p>Three of the most ancient manuscript books that exist today bearing
the name of Apicius date back to the eighth and ninth century. Ever
since the invention of printing Apicius has been edited chiefly in the Latin
language. Details of the manuscript books and printed editions will be
found under the heading of Apiciana on the following pages.</p>

<p>The present version has been based chiefly upon three principal Latin
editions, that of Albanus Torinus, 1541, who had for his authority a codex
he found on the island of Megalona, on the editions of Martinus Lister,
1705-9, who based his work upon that of Humelbergius, 1542, and the
Giarratano-Vollmer edition, 1922.</p>

<p>We have also scrutinized various other editions forming part of our
collection of Apiciana, and as shown by our &ldquo;family tree of Apicius&rdquo; have
drawn either directly or indirectly upon every known source for our information.</p>

<p>The reasons and raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre for this undertaking become sufficiently
clear through Dr. Starr&rsquo;s introduction and through the following critical
review.</p>

<p>It has been often said that the way to a man&rsquo;s heart is through his
stomach; so here is hoping that we may find a better way of knowing old
Rome and antique private life through the study of this cookery book&mdash;Europe&rsquo;s
oldest and Rome&rsquo;s only one in existence today.</p>

<h3>THANKS</h3>

<p>For many helpful hints, for access to works in their libraries and for
their kind and sympathetic interest in this work I am especially grateful
to Professor Dr. Edward Brandt, of Munich; to Professor Dr. Margaret
Barclay Wilson, of Washington, D.C., and New York City; to Mr. Arnold
Shircliffe, and Mr. Walter M. Hill, both of Chicago.</p>

sketch of the slaves operating a hand-mill. These mills were larger
and were driven by donkeys attached to beams stuck in the square
holes. The bake house is to the left, with running water to the right
of the entrance to the oven. The oven itself was constructed

<p class="topcapt">WINE DIPPER</p>

<p class="subcapt">Found in Pompeii. Each end of the long handle takes the form of a
bird&rsquo;s head. The one close to the bowl holds in its bill a stout wire
which is loosely fastened around the neck of the bowl, the two ends
being interlocked. This allows the bowl to tilt sufficiently to hold
its full contents when retired from the narrow opening of the amphora.
The ancients also had dippers with extension handles to reach down to
the bottom of the deep amphora. Ntl. Mus., Naples, 73822; Field M.

<h1 class="padtop padbase">THE BOOK OF APICIUS</h1>

<h2>A STUDY OF ITS TIMES, ITS AUTHORS AND THEIR SOURCES, ITS<br />
AUTHENTICITY AND ITS PRACTICAL USEFULNESS IN MODERN TIMES</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>NYONE who would know something worth while about the private and
public lives of the ancients should be well acquainted with their table.
Then as now the oft quoted maxim stands that man is what he eats.</p>

<p>Much of the ancient life is still shrouded and will forever be hidden by envious
forces that have covered up bygone glory and grandeur. Ground into mealy
dust under the hoofs of barbarian armies! Re-modeled, re-used a hundred times!
Discarded as of no value by clumsy hands! The &ldquo;Crime of Ignorance&rdquo; is a factor
in league with the forces of destruction. Much is destroyed by blind strokes of
fate&mdash;fate, eternally pounding this earth in its everlasting enigmatic efforts to
shape life into something, the purpose of which we do not understand, the
meaning of which we may not even venture to dream of or hope to know.</p>

<p>Whatever there has been preserved by &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; by freaks of chance, by
virtue of its own inherent strength&mdash;whatever has been buried by misers,
fondled, treasured by loving hands of collectors and connoisseurs during all
these centuries&mdash;every speck of ancient dust, every scrap of parchment or
papyrus, a corroded piece of metal, a broken piece of stone or glass, so eagerly
sought by the archaeologists and historians of the last few generations&mdash;all
these fragmentary messages from out of the past emphasize the greatness of
their time. They show its modernity, its nearness to our own days. They are now
hazy reminiscences, as it were, by a middle-aged man of the hopes and the joys
of his own youth. These furtive fragments&mdash;whatever they are&mdash;now tell us a
story so full and so rich, they wield so marvelous a power, no man laying claim
to possessing any intelligence may pass them without intensely feeling the
eternal pathetic appeal to our hearts of these bygone ages that hold us down in
an envious manner, begrudging us the warm life-blood of the present, weaving
invisible ties around us to make our hearts heavy.</p>

<p>However, we are not here to be impeded by any sentimental considerations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Thinking of the past, we are not so much concerned with the picture that dead
men have placed in our path like ever so many bill boards and posters! We do
not care for their &ldquo;ideals&rdquo; expounded in contemporary histories and eulogies.
We are hardly moved by the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; such as they would have loved to see them
happen, nor do we cherish the figments of their human, very human, subconsciousness.</p>

<p>To gain a correct picture of the Roman table we will therefore set aside for a
while the fragments culled from ancient literature and history that have been
misused so indiscriminately and so profusely during the last two thousand years&mdash;for
various reasons. They have become fixed ideas, making reconstruction
difficult for anyone who would gain a picture along rational lines. Barring two
exceptions, there is no trustworthy detailed description of the ancient table by
an objective contemporary observer. To be sure, there are some sporadic efforts,
mere reiterations. The majority of the ancient word pictures are distorted views
on our subject by partisan writers, contemporary moralists on the one side,
satirists on the other. Neither of them, we venture to say, knew the subject professionally.
They were not specialists in the sense of modern writers like Reyni&egrave;re,
Rumohr, Vaerst; nor did they approach in technical knowledge medieval
writers like Martino, Platina, Torinus.</p>

<p>True there were exceptions. Athenaeus, a most prolific and voluble magiric
commentator, quoting many writers and specialists whose names but for him
would have never reached posterity. Athenaeus tells about these gastronomers,
the greatest of them, Archestratos, men who might have contributed so much
to our knowledge of the ancient world, but to us these names remain silent, for
the works of these men have perished with the rest of the great library at the
disposal of this genial host of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Too, there are Anacharsis and Petronius. They and Athenaeus cannot be overlooked.
These three form the bulk of our evidence.</p>

<p>Take on the other hand Plutarch, Seneca, Tertullian, even Pliny, writers
who have chiefly contributed to our defective knowledge of the ancient table.
They were no gourmets. They were biased, unreliable at best, as regards culinary
matters. They deserve our attention merely because they are above the ever
present mob of antique reformers and politicians of whom there was legion in
Rome alone, under the pagan r&eacute;gime. Their state of mind and their intolerance
towards civilized dining did not improve with the advent of Christianity.</p>

<p>The moralists&rsquo; testimony is substantiated and supplemented rather than refuted
by their very antipodes, the satirists, a group headed by Martial, Juvenal
and the incomparable Petronius, who really is in a class by himself.</p>

<p>There is one more man worthy of mention in our particular study, Horace, a
true poet, the most objective of all writers, man-about-town, pet of society,
mundane genius, gifted to look calmly into the innermost heart of his time.
His eyes fastened a correct picture on the sensitive diaphragm of a good memory,
leaving an impression neither distorted nor &ldquo;out of focus.&rdquo; His eye did not &ldquo;pick
up,&rdquo; for sundry reasons, the defects of the objects of observation, nor did it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
work with the uncanny joy of subconscious exaggeration met with so frequently
in modern writing, nor did he indulge in that predilection for ugly detail
sported by modern art.</p>

<p>So much for Horatius, poet. Still, he was not a specialist in our line. We cannot
enroll him among the gifted gourmets no matter how many meals he enjoyed
at the houses of his society friends. We are rather inclined to place him among
the host of writers, ancient and modern, who have treated the subject of food
with a sort of sovereign contempt, or at least with indifference, because its study
presented unsurmountable difficulties, and the subject, <i>per se</i>, was a menial one.
With this attitude of our potential chief witnesses defined, we have no occasion
to further appeal to them here, and we might proceed to real business, to the
sifting of the trustworthy material at hand. It is really a relief to know that we
have no array of formidable authorities to be considered in our study. We have
virgin field before us&mdash;i.e., the ruins of ancient greatness grown over by a
jungle of two thousand years of hostile posterity.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Pompeii</h3>

<p>Pompeii was destroyed in A.D. 79. From its ruins we have obtained in the
last half century more information about the intimate domestic and public life
of the ancients than from any other single source. What is more important, this
vast wealth of information is first hand, unspoiled, undiluted, unabridged, unbiased,
uncensored;&mdash;in short, untouched by meddlesome human hands.</p>

<p>Though only a provincial town, Pompeii was a prosperous mercantile place, a
representative market-place, a favorite resort for fashionable people. The town
had hardly recuperated from a preliminary attack by that treacherous mountain,
Vesuvius, when a second onslaught succeeded in complete destruction.
Suddenly, without warning, this lumbering <i>force majeur</i> visited the ill-fated
towns in its vicinity with merciless annihilation. The population, just then enjoying
the games in the amphitheatre outside of the &ldquo;downtown&rdquo; district, had
had hardly time to save their belongings. They escaped with their bare lives.
Only the aged, the infirm, the prisoners and some faithful dogs were left behind.
Today their bodies in plaster casts may be seen, mute witnesses to a frightful
disaster. The town was covered with an airtight blanket of ashes, lava and fine
pumice stone. There was no prolonged death struggle, no perceivable decay extended
over centuries as was the cruel lot of Pompeii&rsquo;s mistress, Rome. There
were no agonies to speak of. The great event was consummated within a few
hours. The peace of death settled down to reign supreme after the dust had been
driven away by the gentle breezes coming in from the bay of Naples. Some
courageous citizens returned, searching in the hot ashes for the crashed-in roofs
of their villas, to recover this or that. Perhaps they hoped to salvage the strong
box in the atrium, or a heirloom from the triclinium. But soon they gave up.
Despairing, or hoping for better days to come, they vanished in the mist of time.
Pompeii, the fair, the hospitable, the gay city, just like any individual out of
luck, was and stayed forgotten. The Pompeians, their joys, sorrows, their work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and play, their virtues and vices&mdash;everything was arrested with one single
stroke, stopped, even as a camera clicks, taking a snapshot.</p>

<p>The city&rsquo;s destruction, it appears, was a formidable opening blow dealt the
Roman empire in the prime of its life, in a war of extermination waged by hostile
invisible forces. Pompeii makes one believe in &ldquo;Providence.&rdquo; A great disaster
actually moulding, casting a perfect image of the time for future generations!
To be exact, it took these generations eighteen centuries to discover and to appreciate
the heritage that was theirs, buried at the foot of Vesuvius. During
these long dark and dusky centuries charming goat herds had rested unctuous
shocks of hair upon mysterious columns that, like young giant asparagus, stuck
their magnificent heads out of the ground. Blinking drowsily at yonder villainous
mountain, the summit of which is eternally crowned with a halo of thin white
smoke, such as we are accustomed to see arising from the stacks of chemical
factories, the confident shepherd would lazily implore his patron saint to enjoin
that unreliable devilish force within lest the <i>dolce far niente</i> of the afternoon be
disturbed, for siestas are among the most important functions in the life of that
region. Occasionally the more enterprising would arm themselves with pick-axe
and shovel, made bold by whispered stories of fabulous wealth, and, defying the
evil spirits protecting it, they would set out on an expedition of loot and desecration
of the tomb of ancient splendor.</p>

<p>Only about a century and a half ago the archaeological conscience awoke.
Only seventy-five years ago energetic moves made possible a fruitful pilgrimage
to this shrine of humanity, while today not more than two-thirds but perhaps
the most important parts of the city have been opened to our astonished eyes
by men who know.</p>

<p>And now: we may see that loaf of bread baked nineteen centuries ago, as
found in the bake shop. We may inspect the ingenious bake oven where it was
baked. We may see the mills that ground the flour for the bread, and, indeed
find unground wheat kernels. We see the oil still preserved in the jugs, the
residue of wine still in the amphorae, the figs preserved in jars, the lentils, the
barley, the spices in the cupboard; everything awaits our pleasure: the taverns
with their &ldquo;bars&rdquo;; the ancient guests&rsquo; opinion of Mine Host scribbled on the
wall, the kitchens with their implements, the boudoirs of milady&rsquo;s with the
cosmetics and perfumes in the compacts. There are the advertisements on the
walls, the foods praised with all the <i>eclat</i> of modern advertising, the election
notices, the love missives, the bank deposits, the theatre tickets, law records, bills
of sale.</p>

<p>Phantom-like yet real there are the good citizens of a good town, parading,
hustling, loafing&mdash;sturdy patricians, wretched plebeians, stern centurios, boastful
soldiers, scheming politicians, crafty law-clerks, timid scribes, chattering
barbers, bullying gladiators, haughty actors, dusty travelers, making for Albinus&rsquo;,
the famous host at the <i>Via della Abbondanza</i> or, would he give preference
to Sarinus, the son of Publius, who advertised so cleverly? Or, perhaps, could he
afford to stop at the &ldquo;Fortunata&rdquo; Hotel, centrally located?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
There are, too, the boorish hayseeds from out of town trying to sell their
produce, unaccustomed to the fashionable Latin-Greek speech of the city folks,
gaping with their mouths wide open, greedily at the steaks of sacrificial meat
displayed behind enlarging glasses in the cheap cook shop windows. There they
giggle and chuckle, those wily landlords with their blas&eacute; habitu&eacute;s and their
underlings, the greasy cooks, the roguish &ldquo;good mixers&rdquo; at the bar and the
winsome if resolute <i>cop&aelig;</i>&mdash;waitresses&mdash;all ready to go, to do business. So
slippery are the cooks that Plautus calls one <i>Congrio</i>&mdash;sea eel&mdash;so black that
another deserves the title <i>Anthrax</i>&mdash;coal.</p>

<p>There they are, one and all, the characters necessary to make up what we call
civilization, chattering agitatedly in a lingo of Latin-Greek-Oscan&mdash;as if life
were a continuous market day.</p>

<p>It takes no particular scholarship, only a little imagination and human sympathy
to see and to hear the ghosts of Pompeii.</p>

<p>There is no pose about this town, no <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>, no stage-setting. No heroic
gesture. No theatricals, in short, no lies. There is to be found no shred of that
vainglorious cloak which humans will deftly drape about their shoulders whenever
they happen to be aware of the camera. There is no &ldquo;registering&rdquo; of any
kind here.</p>

<p>Pompeii&rsquo;s natural and pleasant disposition, therefore, is ever so much more in
evidence. Not a single one of this charming city&rsquo;s movements was intended for
posterity. Her life stands before our eyes in clear reality, in naked, unadorned
truth. Indeed, there were many things that the good folks would have loved
to point to with pride. You have to search for these now. There are, alas and
alack, a few things they would have hidden, had they only known what was in
store for them. But all these things, good, indifferent and bad, remained in their
places; and here they are, unsuspecting, real, natural, charming like Diana and
her wood nymphs.</p>

<p>Were it not quite superfluous, we would urgently recommend the study of
Pompeii to the students of life in general and to those of Antiquity in particular.
Those who would know something about the ancient table cannot do without
Pompeii.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Three Ancient Writers: Anacharsis, Apicius, Petronius</h3>

<p>To those who lay stress upon documentary evidence or literary testimony, to
those trusting implicitly in the honesty and reliability of writers of fiction, we
would recommend Petronius Arbiter.</p>

<p>His <i>cena Trimalchionis</i>, Trimalchio&rsquo;s dinner, is the sole surviving piece from
the pen of a Roman contemporary, giving detailed information on our subject.
It is, too, the work of a great writer moving in the best circles, and, therefore,
so much more desirable as an expert. Petronius deserves to be quoted in full but
his work is too well-known, and our space too short. However, right here we
wish to warn the student to bear in mind in perusing Petronius that this writer,
in his <i>cena</i>, is not depicting a meal but that he is satirizing a man&mdash;that makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
all the difference in the world as far as we are concerned. Petronius&rsquo; <i>cena</i> is
plainly an exaggeration, but even from its distorted contours the student may
recognize the true lines of an ancient meal.</p>

<p>There is, not so well-known a beautiful picture of an Athenian dinner party
which must not be overlooked, for it contains a wealth of information. Although
Greek, we learn from it much of the Roman conditions. Anacharsis&rsquo; description
of a banquet at Athens, dating back to the fourth century B.C. about the time
when the Periclean r&eacute;gime flourished, is worth your perusal. A particularly good
version of this tale is rendered by Baron Vaerst in his book &ldquo;Gastrosophie,&rdquo;
Leipzig, 1854, who has based his version on the original translation from the
Greek, entitled, <i>Voyage du jeune Anacharsis en Gr&egrave;ce vers le milieu du quatri&egrave;me
si&egrave;cle avant l&rsquo;&egrave;re vulgaire par J. J. Barth&eacute;lemy</i>, Paris, 1824. Vaerst has amplified
the excerpts from the young traveler&rsquo;s observations by quotations from other
ancient Greek writers upon the subject, thus giving us a most beautiful and
authentic ideal description of Greek table manners and habits when Athens had
reached the height in culture, refinement and political greatness.</p>

<p>Anacharsis was not a Hellene but a Scythian visitor. By his own admission he
is no authority on Grecian cookery, but as a reporter he excels.</p>

<p>This truly Hellenic discussion of the art of eating and living at the table of
the cultured Athenians is the most profound discourse we know of, ancient or
modern, on eating. The wisdom revealed in this tale is lasting, and, like Greek
marble, consummate in external beauty and inner worth.</p>

<p>We thus possess the testimony of two contemporary writers which together
with the book of Apicius and with what we learn from Athenaeus should give
a fair picture of ancient eating and cookery.</p>

<p>Apicius is our most substantial witness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this source has not been spared by meddlesome men, and it
has not reached us in its pristine condition. As a matter of fact, Apicius has
been badly mauled throughout the centuries. This book has always attracted
attention, never has it met with indifference. In the middle ages it became the
object of intensive study, interpretation, controversy&mdash;in short it has attracted
interest that has lasted into modern times.</p>

<p>When, with the advent of the dark ages, it ceased to be a practical cookery
book, it became a treasure cherished by the few who preserved the classical
literature, and after the invention of printing it became the object of curiosity,
even mystery. Some interpreters waxed enthusiastic over it, others who failed to
understand it, condemned it as hopeless and worthless.</p>

<p>The pages of our Apiciana plainly show the lasting interest in our ancient
book, particularly ever since its presence became a matter of common knowledge
during the first century of printing.</p>

<p>The Apicius book is the most ancient of European cookery books. However,
Platina&rsquo;s work, <i>de honesta uolvptate</i>, is the first cookery book to appear in
print. Platina, in 1474, was more up-to-date. His book had a larger circulation.
But its vogue stopped after a century while Apicius marched on through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
centuries to come, tantalizing the scholars, amusing the curious gourmets if not
educated cooks to the present day.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Apicius, the Man</h3>

<p>Who was Apicius? This is the surname of several renowned gastronomers of
old Rome. There are many references and anecdotes in ancient literature to men
bearing this name. Two Apicii have definitely been accounted for. The older one,
Marcus A. lived at the time of Sulla about 100 B.C. The man we are most interested
in, M. Gabius Apicius, lived under Augustus and Tiberius, 80 B.C. to
A.D. 40. However, both these men had a reputation for their good table.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Athenaeus on Apicius</h3>

<p>It is worth noting that the well-read Athenaeus, conversant with most authors
of Antiquity makes no mention of the Apicius book. This collection of recipes,
then, was not in general circulation during Athenaei time (beginning of the
third century of our era), that, maybe, it was kept a secret by some Roman
cooks. On the other hand it is possible that the Apicius book did not exist during
the time of Athenaeus in the form handed down to us and that the monographs
on various departments of cookery (most of them of Greek origin, works
of which indeed Athenaeus speaks) were collected after the first quarter of the
third century and were adorned with the name of Apicius merely because his
fame as a gourmet had endured.</p>

<p>What Athenaeus knows about Apicius (one of three known famous eaters
bearing that name) is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;About the time of Tiberius [42 B.C.-37 A.D.] there lived a man, named
Apicius; very rich and luxurious, for whom several kinds of cheesecake
called Apician, are named [not found in our present A.]. He spent myriads
of drachmas on his belly, living chiefly at Minturn&aelig;, a city of Campania, eating
very expensive crawfish, which are found in that place superior in size
to those of Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing, too, that
they were very large in Africa, he sailed thither, without waiting a single
day, and suffered exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the
coast, before he disembarked (for his arrival made a great stir among the
Africans) the fishermen came alongside in their boats and brought him
some very fine crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had any
finer; and when they said that there were none finer than those which they
had brought, he, recollecting those at Minturn&aelig; ordered the master of the
ship to sail back the same way into Italy, without going near the land....</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the emperor Trajan [A.D. 52 or 53-117] was in Parthia [a country
in Asia, part of Persia?] at a distance of many days from the sea, Apicius
sent him fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever contrivance of his
own; real oysters....&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>(The instructions given in our Apicius book, Recipe <a href="#r14">14</a>, for the keeping of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
oysters would hardly guarantee their safe arrival on such a journey as described
above.)</p>

<p>Athenaeus tells us further that many of the Apician recipes were famous and
that many dishes were named after him. This confirms the theory that Apicius
was not the author of the present book but that the book was dedicated to him
by an unknown author or compiler. Athenaeus also mentions one Apion who
wrote a book on luxurious living. Whether this man is identical with the author
or patron of our book is problematic. Torinus, in his <i>epistola dedicatoria</i> to the
1541 edition expresses the same doubt.</p>

<p>Marcus Gabius (or Gavius) Apicius lived during Rome&rsquo;s most interesting
epoch, when the empire had reached its highest point, when the seeds of decline,
not yet apparent, were in the ground, when in the quiet villages of that far-off
province, Palestine, the Saviour&rsquo;s doctrines fascinated humble audiences&mdash;teachings
that later reaching the very heart of the world&rsquo;s mistress were destined
to tarnish the splendor of that autocrat.</p>

<p>According to the mention by various writers, this man, M. Gabius Apicius,
was one of the many ancient gastronomers who took the subject of food seriously.
Assuming a scientific attitude towards eating and food they were criticised
for paying too much attention to their table. This was considered a superfluous
and indeed wicked luxury when frugality was a virtue. These men who knew by
intuition the importance of knowing something about nutrition are only now
being vindicated by the findings of modern science.</p>

<p>M. Gabius Apicius, this most famous of the celebrated and much maligned
bon-vivants, quite naturally took great interest in the preparation of food. He
is said to have originated many dishes himself; he collected much material on
the subject and he endowed a school for the teaching of cookery and for the promotion
of culinary ideas. This very statement by his critics places him high in our
esteem, as it shows him up as a scientist and educator. He spent his vast fortune
for food, as the stories go, and when he had only a quarter million dollars left
(a paltry sum today but a considerable one in those days when gold was scarce
and monetary standards in a worse muddle than today) Apicius took his own
life, fearing that he might have to starve to death some day.</p>

<p>This story seems absurd on the face of it, yet Seneca and Martial tell it (both
with different tendencies) and Suidas, Albino and other writers repeat it without
critical analysis. These writers who are unreliable in culinary matters anyway,
claim that Apicius spent one hundred million <i>sestertii</i> on his appetite&mdash;<i>in
gulam</i>. Finally when the hour of accounting came he found that there were
only ten million <i>sestertii</i> left, so he concluded that life was not worth living if
his gastronomic ideas could no longer be carried out in the accustomed and approved
style, and he took poison at a banquet especially arranged for the occasion.</p>

<p>In the light of modern experience with psychology, with economics, depressions,
journalism, we focus on this and similar stories, and we find them thoroughly
unreliable. We cannot believe this one. It is too melodramatic, too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
moralistic perhaps to suit our modern taste. The underlying causes for the conduct,
life and end of Apicius have not been told. Of course, we have to accept the
facts as reported. If only a Petronius had written that story! What a story it
might have been! But there is only one Petronius in antiquity. His Trimalchio,
former slave, successful profiteer and food speculator, braggard and drunkard,
wife-beater&mdash;an upstart who arranged extravagant banquets merely to show
off, who, by the way, also arranged for his funeral at his banquet (Apician
fashion and, indeed, Petronian fashion! for Petronius died in the same manner)
and who peacefully &ldquo;passed out&rdquo; soundly intoxicated&mdash;this man is a figure true
to life as it was then, as it is now and as it probably will continue to be. Last
but not least: Mrs. Trimalchio, the resolute lady who helped him &ldquo;make his pile&rdquo;&mdash;these
are human characters much more real, much more trustworthy than
anything and everything else ever depicted by any ancient pen; they bring out
so graphically the modernity of antiquity. Without Petronius and Pompeii the
antique world would forever remain at an inexplicably remote distance to our
modern conception of life. With him, and with the dead city, the riddles of
antiquity are cleared up.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Book</h3>

<p>Many dishes listed in Apicius are named for various celebrities who flourished
at a later date than the second Apicius. It is noteworthy, however, that neither
such close contemporaries as Heliogabalus and Nero, notorious gluttons, nor
Petronius, the arbiter of fashion of the period, are among the persons thus
honored. Vitellius, a later glutton, is well represented in the book. It is fair to
assume, then, that the author or collector of our present Apicius lived long after
the second Apicius, or, at least, that the book was augmented by persons posterior
to M. Gabius A. The book in its present state was probably completed
about the latter part of the third century. It is almost certain that many recipes
were added to a much earlier edition.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Probably of Greek Parentage</h3>

<p>We may as well add another to the many speculations by saying that it is
quite probable for our book to originate in a number of Greek manuals or
monographs on specialized subjects or departments of cookery. Such special
treatises are mentioned by Athenaeus (cf. Humelbergius, quoted by Lister).
The titles of each chapter (or book) are in Greek, the text is full of Greek
terminology. While classification under the respective titles is not strictly adhered
to at all times, it is significant that certain subjects, that of fish cookery,
for instance, appear twice in the book, the same subject showing treatment by
widely different hands. Still more significant is the absence in our book of such
important departments as desserts&mdash;<i>dulcia</i>&mdash;confections in which the ancients
were experts. Bakery, too, even the plainest kind, is conspicuously absent in the
Apician books. The latter two trades being particularly well developed, were
departmentalized to an astonishing degree in ancient Greece and Rome. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
indispensable books are simply wanting in our book if it be but a collection of
Greek monographs. Roman culture and refinement of living, commencing about
200-250 years before our era was under the complete rule of Hellas. Greek influence
included everybody from philosophers, artists, architects, actors, law-makers
to cooks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The conquered thus conquered the conquerors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Humelbergius makes a significant reference to the origin of Apicius. We confess,
we have not checked up this worthy editor nor his successor, Dr. Lister,
whom he quotes in the preface as to the origin of our book. With reference to
Plato&rsquo;s work, Humelbergius says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<i>Que res tota spectat medicin&aelig; partem, qu&aelig; diaitetike appelatur, et victu
medetur: at in hac tes diaitetikes parte totus est Apicius noster.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In our opinion, unfounded of course by positive proof, the Apicius book is
somewhat of a gastronomic bible, consisting of ten different books by several
authors, originating in Greece and taken over by the Romans along with the rest
of Greek culture as spoils of war. These books, or chapters, or fragments thereof,
must have been in vogue long before they were collected and assembled in the
present form. Editions, or copies of the same must have been numerous, either
singly or collectively, at the beginning of our era. As a matter of fact, the Excerpts
by Vinidarius, found in the <i>codex Salmasianus</i> prove this theory and
give rise to the assumption that the Apicius book was a standard work for
cookery that existed at one time or other in a far more copious volume and that
the present Apicius is but a fragment of a formerly vaster and more complete
collection of culinary and medical formul&aelig;.</p>

<p>Thus a fragmentary Apicius has been handed down to us in manuscript form
through the centuries, through the revolutionary era of Christian ascendancy,
through the dark ages down to the Renaissance. Unknown agencies, mostly
medical and monastic, stout custodians of antique learning, reverent lovers of
good cheer have preserved it for us until printing made possible the book&rsquo;s wide
distribution among the scholars. Just prior to Gutenberg&rsquo;s epoch-making printing
press there was a spurt of interest in our book in Italy, as attested to by a
dozen of manuscripts, copied in the fourteenth and the fifteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Apicius may justly be called the world&rsquo;s oldest cookery book; the very old
Sanscrit book, Vasavarayeyam, unknown to us except by name, is said to be a
tract on vegetarian cookery.</p>

<p>The men who have preserved this work for future generations, who have
made it accessible to the public (as was Lister&rsquo;s intention) have performed a
service to civilization that is not to be underestimated. They have done better
than the average archaeologist with one or another find to his credit. The Apicius
book is a living thing, capable of creating happiness. Some gastronomic writers
have pointed out that the man who discovers a new dish does more for humanity
than the man who discovers a new star, because the discovery of a new dish
affects the happiness of mankind more pleasantly than the addition of a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
planet to an already overcrowded chart of the universe. Viewing Apicius from
such a materialistic point of view he should become very popular in this age of
ours so keen for utilities of every sort.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">C&oelig;lius-C&aelig;lius</h3>

<p>The name of another personality is introduced in connection with the book,
namely that of C&oelig;lius or C&aelig;lius. This name is mentioned in the title of the first
undated edition (ca. 1483-6) as Celius. Torinus, 1541, places &ldquo;C&aelig;lius&rdquo; before
&ldquo;Apicius&rdquo;; Humelbergius, 1542, places &ldquo;C&oelig;lius&rdquo; after A. Lister approves of
this, berating Torinus for his willful methods of editing the book: &ldquo;<i>En hominem
in conjecturis sane audacissimus!</i>&rdquo; If any of them were correct about &ldquo;C&oelig;lius,&rdquo;
Torinus would be the man. (Cf. Schanz, R&ouml;m. Lit. Gesch., M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s Handbuch
d. klass. Altertums-Wissenschaft, V III, 112, p. 506.) However, there is no
<i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> for C&oelig;lius.</p>

<p>His presence and the unreality thereof has been cleared up by Vollmer, as
will be duly shown. The squabble of the medieval savants has also given rise
to the story that Apicius is but a joke perpetrated upon the world by a medieval
savant. This will be refuted also later on. Our book is a genuine Roman.
Medieval savants have made plenty of Roman &ldquo;fakes,&rdquo; for sundry reasons. A
most ingenious hoax was the &ldquo;completion&rdquo; of the Petronius fragment by a
scholar able to hoodwink his learned contemporaries by an exhibition of Petronian
literary style and a fertile imagination. Ever so many other &ldquo;fakers&rdquo;
were shown up in due time. When this version of Petronius was pronounced
genuine by the scientific world, the perpetrator of the &ldquo;joke&rdquo; confessed, enjoying
a good laugh at the expense of his colleagues. But we shall presently understand
how such a &ldquo;joke&rdquo; with Apicius would be impossible. Meanwhile, we
crave the indulgence of the modern reader with our mention of C&oelig;lius. We
desire to do full justice to the ancient work and complete the presentation of its
history. The controversies that have raged over it make this course necessary.</p>

<p>Our predecessors have not had the benefit of modern communication, and,
therefore, could not know all that is to be known on the subject. We sympathize
with Lister yet do not condemn Torinus. If Torinus ever dared making important
changes in the old text, they are easily ascertained by collation with other
texts. This we have endeavored to do. Explaining the discrepancies, it will be
noted that we have not given a full vote of confidence to Lister.</p>

<p>Why should the mysterious C&oelig;lius or C&aelig;lius, if such an author or compiler
of a tome on cookery existed affix the name of &ldquo;Apicius&rdquo; to it? The reason would
be commercial gain, prestige accruing from the name of that cookery celebrity.
Such business sense would not be extraordinary. Modern cooks pursue the same
method. Witness the innumerable &agrave; la soandsos. Babies, apartment houses,
streets, cities, parks, dogs, race horses, soap, cheese, herring, cigars, hair restorers
are thus named today. &ldquo;Apicius&rdquo; on the front page of any ancient cookery book
would be perfectly consistent with the ancient spirit of advertising. It has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
stated, too, that C&oelig;lius had more than one collaborator. Neither can this be
proven.</p>

<p>The copyists have made many changes throughout the original text. Misspelling
of terms, ignorance of cookery have done much to obscure the meaning.
The scribes of the middle ages had much difficulty in this respect since medieval
Latin is different from Apician language.</p>

<p>The very language of the original is proof for its authenticity. The desire of
Torinus to interpret to his medieval readers the ancient text is pardonable. How
much or how little he succeeded is attested to by some of his contemporary
readers, former owners of our copies. Scholars plainly confess inability to
decipher Apicius by groans inscribed on the fly leaves and title pages in Latin,
French and other languages. One French scholar of the 16th century, apparently
&ldquo;kidded&rdquo; for studying an undecipherable cook book, stoically inscribes the
title page of our Lyon, 1541, copy with: &ldquo;This amuses me. Why make fun of
me?&rdquo; This sort of message, reaching us out of the dim past of bygone centuries
is among the most touching reading we have done, and has urged us on with
the good though laborious and unprofitable work.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its drawbacks, our book is a classic both as to form and
contents. It has served as a prototype of most ancient and modern books. Its
influence is felt to the present day.</p>

<p>The book has often been cited by old writers as proof of the debaucheries and
the gluttony of ancient Rome. Nothing could be further from the truth because
these writers failed to understand the book.</p>

<p>The Apicius book reflects the true condition (partly so, because it is incomplete)
of the kitchen prevailing at the beginning of our era when the mistress
of the Old World was in her full regalia, when her ample body had not yet
succumbed to that fatty degeneration of the interior so fatal to ever so many
individuals, families, cities and nations.</p>

<p>We repeat, our Apicius covers Rome&rsquo;s healthy epoch; hence the importance
of the book. The voluptuous concoctions, the fabulous dishes, the proverbial
excesses that have made decent people shudder with disgust throughout the ages
are not known to Apicius. If they ever existed at all in their traditional ugliness
they made their appearance after Apicius&rsquo; time. We recall, Petronius, describing
some of these &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; is a contemporary of Nero (whom he satirizes as
&ldquo;Trimalchio&rdquo;). So is Seneca, noble soul, another victim of C&aelig;sarean insanity;
he, too, describes Imperial excesses. These extremely few foolish creations are
really at the bottom of the cause for this misunderstanding of true Roman life.
Such stupidity has allowed the joy of life which, as Epikuros and Platina believe,
may be indulged in with perfect virtue and honesty to become a byword among
all good people who are not gastronomers either by birth, by choice or by
training.</p>

<p>With due justice to the Roman people may we be permitted to say that
proverbial excesses were exceedingly rare occurrences. The follies and the vices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of a Nero, a boy Heliogabalus, a Pollio, a Vitellius and a few other notorious
wasters are spread sporadically over a period of at least eight hundred years.
Between these cases of gastronomic insanity lie wellnigh a thousand years of
everyday grind and drudgery of the Roman people. The bulk was miserably fed
as compared with modern standards of living. Only a few patricians could
afford &ldquo;high living.&rdquo; Since a prosperous bourgeoisie (usually the economic and
gastronomic background of any nation) was practically unknown in Rome,
where the so-called middle classes were in reality poor, shiftless and floating
freedmen, it is evident that the bulk of the population because of the empire&rsquo;s
unsettled economic conditions, its extensive system of slavery (precluding all
successful practice of trades by freemen), the continuous military operations, the
haphazard financial system, was forced to live niggardly. The contrast between
the middle classes and the upper classes seemed very cruel. This condition may
account for the many outcries against the &ldquo;extravagances&rdquo; of the few privileged
ones who could afford decent food and for the exaggerated stories about
their table found in the literature of the time.</p>

<p>The seemingly outlandish methods of Apician food preparation become plain
and clear in the light of social evolution. &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; is perhaps not the right
word to convey our idea of social perpetual motion.</p>

<p>Apicius used practically all the cooking utensils in use today. He only lacked
gas, electricity and artificial refrigeration, modern achievements while useful in
the kitchen and indispensable in wholesale production and for labor saving, that
have no bearing on purely gastronomical problems. There is only one difference
between the cooking utensils of yore and the modern products: the old ones are
hand-made, more individualistic, more beautiful, more artistic than our machine-made
varieties.</p>

<p>Despite his strangeness and remoteness, Apicius is not dead by any means.
We have but to inspect (as Gollmer has pointed out) the table of the Southern
Europeans to find Apician traditions alive. In the Northern countries, too, are
found his traces. To think that Apicius should have survived in the North of
Europe, far removed from his native soil, is a rather audacious suggestion. But
the keen observer can find him in Great Britain, Scandinavia and the Baltic
provinces today. The conquerors and seafarers coming from the South have
carried the pollen of gastronomic flowers far into the North where they adjusted
themselves to soil and climate. Many a cook of the British isles, of Southern
Sweden, Holstein, Denmark, Friesland, Pomerania still observes Apicius rules
though he may not be aware of the fact.</p>

<p>We must realize that Apicius is only a book, a frail hand-made record and
that, while the record itself might have been forgotten, its principles have
become international property, long ago. Thus they live on. Like a living thing&mdash;a
language, a custom, they themselves may have undergone changes, &ldquo;improvements,&rdquo;
alterations, augmentation, corruption. But the character has been
preserved; a couple of thousand years are, after all, but a paltry matter. Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
own age is but the grandchild of antiquity. The words we utter, in their roots,
are those of our grandfathers. And so do many dishes we eat today resemble
those once enjoyed by Apicius and his friends.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to point the tenacity of the spirit of the Antique, reaching
deep into the modern age? The latest Apicius edition in the original Latin is
dated 1922!</p>

<p>The gastronomic life of Europe was under the complete rule of old Rome
until the middle of the seventeenth century. Then came a sudden change for
modernity, comparable to the rather abrupt change of languages from the
fashionable Latin to the national idioms and vernacular, in England and Germany
under the influence of literary giants like Luther, Chaucer, Shakespeare.</p>

<p>All medieval food literature of the continent and indeed the early cookery
books of England prior to La Varenne (Le Cuisinier Fran&ccedil;ois, 1654) are deeply
influenced by Apicius. The great change in eating, resulting in a new gastronomic
order, attained its highest peak of perfection just prior to the French
revolution. Temporarily suspended by this social upheaval, it continued to
flourish until about the latter part of last century. The last decades of this new
order is often referred to as the classical period of gastronomy, with France
claiming the laurels for its development. &ldquo;Classic&rdquo; for reasons we do not know
(Urbain Dubois, outstanding master of this period wrote &ldquo;La Cuisine classique&rdquo;)
except that its precepts appeal as classical to our notion of eating. This may not
correspond to the views of posterity, we had therefore better wait a century or
two before proclaiming our system of cookery &ldquo;classical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Disposing of that old &ldquo;classic,&rdquo; Apicius, as slowly as a conservative cooking
world could afford to do, the present nations set out to cultivate a taste for
things that a Roman would have pronounced unfit for a slave. Still, the world
moves on. Conquest, discovery of foreign parts, the New World, contributed
fine things to the modern table,&mdash;old forgotten foods were rediscovered&mdash;endless
lists of materials and combinations, new daring, preposterous dishes that
made the younger generation rejoice while old folks looked on gasping with
dismay, despair, contempt.</p>

<p>Be it sufficient to remark that the older practitioners of our own days, educated
in &ldquo;classic&rdquo; cuisine again are quite apprehensive of their traditions endangered
by the spirit of revolt of the young against the old. Again and again we
hear of a decline that has set in, and even by the best authorities alarmist notes
are spread to the effect that &ldquo;we have begun our journey back, step by step to
our primitive tree and our primitive nuts&rdquo; (Pennell. Does Spengler consider
food in his &ldquo;Decline of the West?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>It matters not whether we share this pessimism, nor what we may have to say
<i>pro</i> or <i>con</i> this question of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; or &ldquo;retrogression&rdquo; in eating (or in anything
else for that matter). In fact we are not concerned with the question here
more than to give it passing attention.</p>

<p>If &ldquo;classic&rdquo; cookery is dying nowadays, if it cannot reassert itself that would
be a loss to mankind. But this classic cookery system has so far only been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sole and exclusive privilege of a dying aristocracy. It seems quite in order that
it should go under in the great <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i> that commenced with the
German peasants wars of the sixteenth century, flaring up (as the second act)
in the French revolution late in the eighteenth century, the Act III of which
drama has been experienced in our own days.</p>

<p>The common people as yet have never had an active part in the enjoyment
of the classic art of eating. So far, they always provided the wherewithal, and
looked on, holding the bag. Modern hotels, because of their commercial character,
have done little to perpetuate it. They merely have commercialized the
art. Beyond exercising ordinary salesmanship, our <i>ma&icirc;tres d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</i> have not
educated our <i>nouveaux riches</i> in the mysteries and delights of gastronomy.
Hotelmen are not supposed to be educators, they merely cater to a demand. And
our new aristocracy has been too busy with limousines, golf, divorces and electricity
to bemourn the decline of classic cookery.</p>

<p>Most people &ldquo;get by&rdquo; without the benefit of classic cookery, subsisting on a
medley of edibles, tenaciously clinging to mother&rsquo;s traditions, to things &ldquo;as she
used to make them,&rdquo; and mother&rsquo;s methods still savor of Apicius. Surely, this
is no sign of retrogression but of tenacity.</p>

<p>The only fundamental difference between Roman dining and that of our own
times may be found in these two indisputable facts&mdash;</p>

<p>(First) Devoid of the science of agriculture, without any advanced mechanical
means, food was not raised in a very systematic way; if it happened to be
abundant, Roma lacked storage and transportation facilities to make good use
of it. There never were any food supplies on any large, extensive and scientific
scale, hence raw materials, the wherewithal of a &ldquo;classic&rdquo; meal, were expensive.</p>

<p>(Second) Skilled labor, so vital for the success of any good dinner, so imperative
for the rational preparation of food was cheap to those who held slaves.</p>

<p>Hence, the culinary conditions of ancient Rome were exactly the opposite
of today&rsquo;s state of affairs. Then, good food was expensive while good labor was
cheap. Now, good food is cheap while skilled labor is at a premium. Somehow,
good, intelligent &ldquo;labor&rdquo; is reluctant to devote itself to food. That is another
story. The chances for a good dinner seemed to be in favor of the Romans&mdash;but
only for a favored few. Those of us, although unable to command a staff
of experts, but able to prepare their own meals rationally and serve them well
are indeed fortunate. With a few dimes they may dine in royal fashion. If our
much maligned age has achieved anything at all it has at least enabled the
working &ldquo;slave&rdquo; of the &ldquo;masses&rdquo; to dine in a manner that even princes could
hardly match in former days, a manner indeed that the princes of our own time
could not improve upon. The fly in the ointment is that most modern people
do not know how to handle and to appreciate food. This condition, however,
may be remedied by instruction and education.</p>

<p>Slowly, the modern masses are learning to emulate their erstwhile masters in
the art of eating. They have the advantages of the great improvements in provisioning
as compared with former days, thanks chiefly to the great lines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
communication established by modern commerce, thanks to scientific agriculture
and to the spirit of commercial enterprise and its resulting prosperity.</p>

<p>There are two &ldquo;Ifs&rdquo; in the path to humanity&rsquo;s salvation, at least, that of its
table. If the commercialization of cookery, i.e., the wholesale production of
ready-made foods for the table does not completely enthrall the housewife and
if we can succeed to educate the masses to make rational, craftsmanlike use of
our wonderful stores of edibles, employing or modifying to this end the rules of
classic cookery, there really should be no need for any serious talk about our
journey back to the primitive nuts. Even Spengler might be wrong then. Adequate
distribution of our foods and rational use thereof seem to be one of the
greatest problems today.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Authenticity of Apicius</h3>

<p>Age-old mysteries surrounding our book have not yet been cleared up.
Medieval savants have squabbled in vain. Mrs. Pennell&rsquo;s worries and the fears
of the learned Englishmen that Apicius might be a hoax have proven groundless.
Still, the mystery of this remarkable book is as perplexing as ever. The authorship
will perhaps never be established. But let us forever dispel any doubt about
its authenticity.</p>

<p>Modern writers have never doubted the genuineness. To name but a few who
believe in Apicius: Thudichum, Vollmer, Brandt, Vicaire, Rumohr, Schuch,
Habs, Gollmer.</p>

<p>What matters the identity of the author? Who wrote the Iliad, the Odyssey,
the Nibelungen-Lied? Let us be thankful for possessing them!</p>

<p>Apicius is a genuine document of Roman imperial days. There can be no
doubt of that!</p>

<p>The unquestionable age of the earliest known manuscripts alone suffices to
prove this.</p>

<p>The philologist gives his testimony, too. A medieval scholar could never have
manufactured Apicius, imitating his strikingly original terminology. &ldquo;Faking&rdquo;
a technical treatise requires an intimate knowledge of technical terms and
familiarity with the ramifications of an intricate trade. We recommend a comparison
of Platina&rsquo;s text with Apicius: the difference of ancient and medieval
Latin is convincing. Striking examples of this kind have been especially noted
in our dictionary of technical terms.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Latin Slang</h3>

<p>H. C. Coote, in his commentary on Apicius (cit. Apiciana) in speaking of
pan gravy, remarks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Apicius calls this by the singular phrase of <i>jus de suo sibi</i>! and sometimes
though far less frequently, <i>succus suus</i>. This phrase is curious enough in
itself to deserve illustration. It is true old fashioned Plautian Latinity, and
if other proof were wanting would of itself demonstrate the genuineness of
the Apician text.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
This scholar goes on quoting from Plautus, <i>Captivi</i>, Act I, sc. 2, vv. 12, 13;
<i>Amphitruo</i>, Act I, sc. q.v. 116 and <i>ibid.</i> v. 174; and from <i>Asinaria</i>,
Act IV, sc. 2, vv. 16 and 17 to prove this, and he further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;The phrase is a rare remnant of the old familiar language of Rome, such
as slaves talked so long, that their masters ultimately adopted it&mdash;a language
of which Plautus gives us glimpses and which the <i>graffiti</i> may perhaps help
to restore. When Varius was emperor, this phrase of the kitchen was as
rife as when Plautus wrote&mdash;a proof that occasionally slang has been long
lived.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Coote is a very able commentator. He has translated in the article quoted a
number of Apician formul&aelig;; and betrays an unusual culinary knowledge.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Modern Research</h3>

<p>Modern means of communication and photography have enabled scientists in
widely different parts to study our book from all angles, to scrutinize the
earliest records, the Vatican and the New York manuscripts and the codex
Salmasianus in Paris.</p>

<p>Friedrich Vollmer, of Munich, in his <i>Studien</i> (cit. Apiciana) has treated the
manuscripts exhaustively, carrying to completion the research begun by Schuch,
Traube, Ihm, Studemund, Giarratano and others with Brandt, his pupil, carrying
on the work of Vollmer. More modern scientists deeply interested in the
origin of our book! None doubting its genuineness.</p>

<p>Vollmer is of the opinion that there reposed in the monastery of Fulda, Germany,
an <i>Archetypus</i> which in the ninth century was copied twice: once in a
Turonian hand&mdash;the manuscript now kept in the Vatican&mdash;the other copy
written partly in insular, partly in Carolingian minuscle&mdash;the Cheltenham
<i>codex</i>, now in New York. The common source at Fulda of these two manuscripts
has been established by Traube. There is another testimony pointing to
Fulda as the oldest known source. Pope Nicholas V commissioned Enoche of
Ascoli to acquire old manuscripts in Germany. Enoche used as a guide a list of
works based upon observations by Poggio in Germany in 1417, listing the
Apicius of Fulda. Enoche acquired the Fulda Apicius. He died in October or
November, 1457. On December 10th of that year, so we know, Giovanni
de&rsquo;Medici requested Stefano de&rsquo;Nardini, Governor of Ancona, to procure for
him from Enoche&rsquo;s estate either in copy or in the original the book, entitled,
<i>Appicius de re quoquinaria</i> (cf. No. <a href="#apiciana_3">3</a>, Apiciana). It is interesting to note that
one of the Milanese editions of 1498 bears a title in this particular spelling.
Enoche during his life time had lent the book to Giovanni Aurispa.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that Poggio, in 1417, viewed at Fulda the <i>Archetypus</i>
of our Apicius, father of the Vatican and the New York manuscripts, then
already mutilated and wanting books <a href="#book_ix">IX</a> and <a href="#book_x">X</a>. Six hundred years before
the arrival of Poggio the Fulda book was no longer complete. Already in the ninth
century its title page had been damaged which is proven by the title page of the
Vatican copy which reads:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I<span class="btop">NCP</span><br />
API<br />
C&AElig;</p>
</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s all! The New York copy, it has been noted, has no title page. This
book commences in the middle of the list of chapters; the first part of them and
the title page are gone. We recall that the New York manuscript was originally
bound up with another manuscript, also in the Phillipps library at Cheltenham.
The missing page or pages were probably lost in separating the two manuscripts.
It is possible that Enoche carried with him to Italy one of the ancient copies,
very likely the present New York copy, then already without a title. At any
rate, not more than twenty-five years after his book hunting expedition we find
both copies in Italy. It is strange, furthermore, that neither of these two ancient
copies were used by the fifteenth century copyists to make the various copies
distributed by them, but that an inferior copy of the Vatican Ms. became the
<i>vulgata</i>&mdash;the progenitor of this series of medieval copies. One must bear in
mind how assiduously medieval scribes copied everything that appeared to be
of any importance to them, and how each new copy by virtue of human fallibility
or self-sufficiency must have suffered in the making, and it is only by very
careful comparison of the various manuscripts that the original text may be
rehabilitated.</p>

<p>This, to a large extent, Vollmer and Giarratano have accomplished. Vollmer,
too, rejects the idea invented by the humanists, that Apicius had a collaborator,
editor or commentator in the person of C&oelig;lius or C&aelig;lius. This name, so Vollmer
claims, has been added to the book by medieval scholars without any reason except
conjecture for such action. They have been misled by the mutilated title:
Api... C&aelig;...; Vollmer reconstructs this title as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>API[cii artis magiri-&nbsp;(or) opsartyti-]<br />
C&AElig;[libri X]</p>
</div>

<p>Remember, it is the title page only that is thus mutilated. The ten books or
chapters bear the full name of Apicius, never at any time does the name of
C&oelig;lius appear in the text, or at the head of the chapters.</p>

<p>The <i>Archetypus</i>, with the book and the chapters carefully indexed and numbered
as they were, with each article neatly titled, the captions and capital letters
rubricated&mdash;heightened by red color, and with its proper spacing of the
articles and chapters must once have been a representative example of the art of
book making as it flourished towards the end of the period that sealed the fate
of the Roman empire, when books of a technical nature, law books, almanacs,
army lists had been developed to a high point of perfection. Luxurious finish,
elaborate illumination point to the fact that our book (the Vatican copy) was
intended for the use in some aristocratic household.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Excerpts of Vinidarius</h3>

<p>And now, from a source totally different than the two important manuscripts
so much discussed here, we receive additional proof of the authenticity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Apicius. In the <i>codex Salmasianus</i> (cf. <a href="#apiciana_iii">III</a>, Apiciana) we find some thirty
formul&aelig; attributed to Apicius, entitled: <i>Apici excerpta a Vinidario vir. inl.</i> They
have been accepted as genuine by Salmasius and other early scholars. Schuch
incorporated the <i>excerpta</i> with his Apicius, placing the formul&aelig; in what he
believed to be the proper order. This course, for obvious reasons, is not to be
recommended. To be sure, the <i>excerpta</i> are Apician enough in character, though
only a few correspond to, or are actual duplicates of, the Apician precepts. They
are additions to the stock of authentic Apician recipes. As such, they may not
be included but be appended to the traditional text. The <i>excerpta</i> encourage the
belief that at the time of Vinidarius (got. Vinithaharjis) about the fifth century
there must have been in circulation an Apicius (collection of recipes) much
more complete than the one handed down to us through Fulda. It is furthermore
interesting to note that the <i>excerpta</i>, too, are silent about C&oelig;lius.</p>

<p>We may safely join Vollmer in his belief that M. Gabius Apicius, celebrated
gourmet living during the reign of Tiberius was the real author, or collector, or
sponsor of this collection of recipes, or at least of the major part thereof&mdash;the
formul&aelig; bearing the names of posterior gourmets having been added from time
to time. This theory also applies to the two instances where the name of Varro
is mentioned in connection with the preparation of beets and onions (bulbs).
It is hardly possible that the author of the book made these references to Varro.
It is more probable that some well-versed posterior reader, perusing the said
articles, added to his copy: &ldquo;And Varro prepared beets this way, and onions
that way....&rdquo; (cf. Book <a href="#book_iii">III</a>, [<a href="#r70">70</a>]) Still, there is no certainty in this theory
either. There were many persons by the names of Commodus, Trajanus, Frontinianus,
such as are appearing in our text, who were contemporaries of Apicius.</p>

<p>With our mind at ease as regards the genuineness of our book we now may
view it at a closer range.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Obscure Terminology</h3>

<p>Apicius contains technical terms that have been the subject of much speculation
and discussion. <i>Liquamen</i>, <i>laser</i>, <i>muria</i>, <i>garum</i>, etc., belong to these.
They will be found in our little dictionary. But we cannot refrain from discussing
some at present to make intelligible the most essential part of the ancient
text.</p>

<p>Take <i>liquamen</i> for instance. It may stand for broth, sauce, stock, gravy, drippings,
even for <i>court bouillon</i>&mdash;in fact for any liquid appertaining to or derived
from a certain dish or food material. Now, if Apicius prescribes <i>liquamen</i>
for the preparation of a meat or a vegetable, it is by no means clear to the uninitiated
what he has in mind. In fact, in each case the term <i>liquamen</i> is subject
to the interpretation of the experienced practitioner. Others than he would at
once be confronted with an unsurmountable difficulty. Scientists may not agree
with us, but such is kitchen practice. Hence the many fruitless controversies at
the expense of the original, at the disappointment of science.</p>

<p><i>Garum</i> is another word, one upon which much contemptuous witticism and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
serious energy has been spent. <i>Garum</i> simply is a generic name for fish essences.
True, <i>garus</i> is a certain and a distinct kind of Mediterranean fish, originally used
in the manufacture of <i>garum</i>; but this product, in the course of time, has been
altered, modified, adulterated,&mdash;in short, has been changed and the term
has naturally been applied to all varieties and variations of fish essences, without
distinction, and it has thus become a collective term, covering all varieties of
fish sauces. Indeed, the corruption and degeneration of this term, <i>garum</i>, had so
advanced at the time of Vinidarius in the fifth century as to lose even its association
with any kind of fish. Terms like <i>garatum</i> (prepared with g.) have been
derived from it. Prepared with the addition of wine it becomes <i>&oelig;nogarum</i>,&mdash;wine
sauce&mdash;and dishes prepared with such wine sauce receive the adjective
of <i>&oelig;nogaratum</i>, and so forth.</p>

<p>The original <i>garum</i> was no doubt akin to our modern anchovy sauce, at
least the best quality of the ancient sauce. The principles of manufacture surely
are alike. <i>Garum</i>, like our anchovy sauce, is the <i>pur&eacute;e</i> of a small fish, named
<i>garus</i>, as yet unidentified. The fish, intestines and all, was spiced, pounded,
fermented, salted, strained and bottled for future use. The finest <i>garum</i> was made
of the livers of the fish only, exposed to the sun, fermented, somehow preserved.
It was an expensive article in old Rome, famed for its medicinal properties. Its
mode of manufacture has given rise to much criticism and scorn on the part of
medieval and modern commentators and interpreters who could not comprehend
the &ldquo;perverse taste&rdquo; of the ancients in placing any value on the &ldquo;essence from
putrified intestines of fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, <i>garum</i> has been vindicated, confirmed, endorsed, reiterated,
rediscovered, if you please, by modern science! What, pray, is the difference in principle
between <i>garum</i> (the exact nature of which is unknown) and the oil of the
liver of cod (or less expensive fish) exposed to the beneficial rays of ultraviolet
light&mdash;artificial sunlight&mdash;to imbue the oil with an extra large and uniform
dose of vitamin D? The ancients, it appears, knew &ldquo;vitamin D&rdquo; to exist. Maybe
they had a different name for &ldquo;vitamins,&rdquo; maybe none at all. The name does not
matter. The thing which they knew, does. They knew the nutritive value of
liver, proven by many formul&aelig;. Pollio, one of the vicious characters of antiquity,
fed murenas (sea-eel) with slaves he threw into the <i>piscina</i>, the fish pond, and
later enjoyed the liver of the fish.</p>

<p>Some &ldquo;modern&rdquo; preparations are astonishingly ancient, and <i>vice versa</i>. Our
anchovy sauce is used freely to season fish, to mix with butter, to be made into
solid anchovy or fish paste. There are sardine pastes, lobster pastes, fish forcemeats
found in the larder of every good kitchen&mdash;preparations of Apician
character. A real platter of <i>hors d&rsquo;oeuvres</i>, an <i>antipasto</i> is not complete unless
made according to certain Apician precepts.</p>

<p><i>Muria</i> is salt water, brine, yet it may stand for a fluid in which fish or meat,
fruits or vegetables have been pickled.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the translator of Apicius who takes him literally, are unconsciously
but neatly demonstrated by the work of Danneil. Even he, seasoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
practitioner, condemns <i>garum</i>, <i>muria</i>, <i>asa f&oelig;tida</i>, because professors before him
have done so, because he forgets that these very materials still form a vital part of
some of his own sauces only in a different shape, form or under a different name.
Danneil calls some Apician recipes &ldquo;incredibly absurd,&rdquo; &ldquo;fabulous,&rdquo; &ldquo;exaggerated,&rdquo;
but he thinks nothing of the serving of similar combinations in his
own establishment every day in the year.</p>

<p>Danneil would take pride in serving a Veal Cutlet &agrave; la Holstein. (What have
we learned of Apicius in the Northern countries?). The ancient Holsteiner was
not satisfied unless his piece of veal was covered with a nice fat herring. That
&ldquo;barbarity&rdquo; had to be modified by us moderns into a veal cutlet, turned in milk
and flour, eggs and bread crumbs, fried, covered with fried eggs, garnished with
anchovies or bits of herring, red beets, capers, and lemon in order to qualify for
a restaurant favorite and &ldquo;best seller.&rdquo; Apicius hardly has a dish more characteristic
and more bewildering.</p>

<p>What of combinations of fish and meat?</p>

<p><i>De gustibus non est disputandum.</i> It all goes into the same stomach. May it be
a sturdy one, and let its owner beware. What of our turkey and oyster dressing?
Of our broiled fish and bacon? Of our clam chowder, our divine <i>Bouillabaisse</i>?
If the ingredients and component parts of such dishes were enumerated
in the laconic and careless Apician style, if they were stated without explicit
instructions and details (supposed to be known to any good practitioner) we
would have recipes just as mysterious as any of the Apician formul&aelig;.</p>

<p>Danneil, like ever so many interpreters, plainly shared the traditional belief,
the egregious errors of popular history. People still are under the spell of the
fantastic and fanciful descriptions of Roman conviviality and gastronomic eccentricities.
Indeed, we rather believe in the insanity of these descriptions than
in the insane conduct of the average Roman gourmet. It is absurd of course to
assume and to make the world believe that a Roman patrician made a meal of
<i>garum</i>, <i>laserpitium</i>, and the like. They used these condiments judiciously; any
other use thereof is physically impossible. They economized their spices which
have caused so much comment, too. As a matter of fact, they used condiments
niggardly and sparingly as is plainly described in some formul&aelig;, if only for the
one good and sufficient reason that spices and condiments which often came from
Asia and Africa were extremely expensive. This very reason, perhaps, caused
much of the popular outcry against their use, which, by the way, is merely another
form of political propaganda, in which, as we shall see, the mob guided by
the rabble of politicians excelled.</p>

<p>We moderns are just as &ldquo;extravagant&rdquo; (if not more) in the use of sauces and
condiments&mdash;Apician sauces, too! Our Worcestershire, catsup, chili, chutney,
walnut catsup, A I, Harvey&rsquo;s, Punch, Soyer&rsquo;s, Escoffier&rsquo;s, Oscar&rsquo;s (every culinary
coryphee endeavors to create one)&mdash;our mustards and condiments in their
different forms, if not actually dating back to Apicius, are, at least lineal descendants
from ancient prototypes.</p>

<p>To readers little experienced in kitchen practice such phrases (often repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by Apicius) as, &ldquo;crush pepper, lovage, marjoram,&rdquo; etc., etc., may appear stereotyped
and monotonous. They have not survived in modern kitchen parlance,
because the practice of using spices, flavors and aromas has changed. There are
now in the market compounds, extracts, mixtures not used in the old days. Many
modern spices come to us ready ground or mixed, or compounded ready for
kitchen use. This has the disadvantage in that volatile properties deteriorate more
rapidly and that the goods may be easily adulterated. The Bavarians, under
Duke Albrecht, in 1553 prohibited the grinding of spices for that very reason!
Ground spices are time and labor savers, however. Modern kitchen methods have
put the old mortar practically out of existence, at the expense of quality of the
finished product.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The &ldquo;Labor Item&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The enviable Apicius cared naught for either time or labor. He gave these two
important factors in modern life not a single thought. His culinary procedures
required a prodigious amount of labor and effort on the part of the cooks and
their helpers. The labor item never worried any ancient employer. It was either
very cheap or entirely free of charge.</p>

<p>The selfish gourmet (which gourmet is not selfish?) almost wonders whether
the abolition of slavery was a well-advised measure in modern social and economic
life. Few people appreciate the labor cost in excellent cookery and few
have any conception of the cost of good food service today. Yet all demand both,
when &ldquo;dining out,&rdquo; at least. Who, on the other hand, but a brute would care to
dine well, &ldquo;taking it out of the hide of others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hence we moderns with a craving for <i>gourmandise</i> but minus appropriations
for skilled labor would do well to follow the example of Alexandre Dumas who
cheerfully and successfully attended to his own cuisine. Despite an extensive
fiction practice he found time to edit &ldquo;Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine&rdquo; and
was not above writing mustard advertisements, either.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Sumptuary Laws</h3>

<p>The appetite of the ancients was at times successfully curbed by sumptuary
laws, cropping out at fairly regular intervals. These laws, usually given under
the pretext of safeguarding the morals of the people and accompanied by similar
euphonious phrases were, like modern prohibitions, vicious and virulent effusions
of the predatory instinct in mankind. We cannot give a chronological list of
them here, and are citing them merely to illustrate the difficulty confronting
the prospective ancient host.</p>

<p>During the reign of C&aelig;sar and Augustus severe laws were passed, fixing the
sums to be spent for public and private dinners and specifying the edibles
to be consumed. These laws classified gastronomic functions with an ingenious
eye for system, professing all the time to protect the public&rsquo;s morals and health;
but they were primarily designed to replenish the ever-vanishing contents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the Imperial exchequer and to provide soft jobs for hordes of enforcers.
The amounts allowed to be spent for various social functions were so ridiculously
small in our own modern estimation that we may well wonder how a Roman
host could have ever made a decent showing at a banquet. However, he and the
cooks managed somehow. Imperial spies and informers were omnipresent. The
market places were policed, the purchases by prospective hosts carefully noted,
dealers selling supplies and cooks (the more skillful kind usually) hired for the
occasion were bribed to reveal the &ldquo;menu.&rdquo; Dining room windows had to be
located conveniently to allow free inspection from the street of the dainties
served; the passing Imperial food inspector did not like to intrude upon the
sanctity of the host&rsquo;s home. The pitiable host of those days, his unenviable guests
and the bewildered cooks, however, contrived and conspired somehow to get up
a banquet that was a trifle better than a Chicago quick lunch.</p>

<p>How did they do it?</p>

<p>In the light of modern experience gained by modern governments dillydallying
with sumptuary legislation that has been discarded as a bad job some two
thousand years ago, the question seems superfluous.</p>

<p><i>Difficile est satyram non scribere!</i> To make a long story short: The Roman
host just broke the law, that&rsquo;s all. Indeed, those who made the laws were first
to break them. The minions, appointed to uphold the law, were easily accounted
for. Any food inspector too arduous in the pursuit of his duty was disposed of
by dispatching him to the rear entrance of the festive hall, and was delivered
to the tender care of the chief cook.</p>

<p>Such was the case during the times of Apicius. Indeed, the Roman idea of
good cheer during earlier epochs was provincial enough. It was simply barbaric
before the Greeks showed the Romans a thing or two in cookery. The methods
of fattening fowl introduced from Greece was something unheard-of! It was
outrageous, sacrilegious! Senators, orators and other self-appointed saviors of
humanity thundered against the vile methods of tickling the human palate,
deftly employing all the picturesque tam-tam and <i>&eacute;lan</i> still the stock in trade
of ever so many modern colleagues in any civilized parliament. The speeches, to
be sure, passed into oblivion, the fat capons, however, stayed in the barnyards
until they had acquired the saturation point of tender luscious calories to be
enjoyed by those who could afford them. How the capon was &ldquo;invented&rdquo; is told
in a note on the subject.</p>

<p>Many other so-called luxuries, sausage from Epirus, cherries from the Pontus,
oysters from England, were greeted with a studied hostility by those who
profited from the business of making laws and public opinion.</p>

<p>Evidently, the time and the place was not very propitious for gastronomic
over-indulgence. Only when the ice was broken, when the disregard for law and
order had become general through the continuous practice of contempt for an
unpopular sumptuary law, when corruption had become wellnigh universal
chiefly thanks to the examples set by the higher-ups, it was then that the torrent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of human passion and folly ran riot, exceeding natural bounds, tearing everything
with them, all that is beautiful and decent, thus swamping the great
empire beyond the hopes for any recovery.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Apicius the Writer</h3>

<p>Most of the Apician directions are vague, hastily jotted down, carelessly edited.
One of the chief reasons for the eternal misunderstandings! Often the author
fails to state the quantities to be used. He has a mania for giving undue prominence
to expensive spices and other (quite often irrelevant) ingredients. Plainly,
Apicius was no writer, no editor. He was a cook. He took it for granted that
spices be used within the bounds of reason, but he could not afford to forget
them in his formul&aelig;.</p>

<p>Apicius surely pursues the correct culinary principle of incorporating the
flavoring agents during the process of cooking, contrary to many moderns who,
vigorously protesting against &ldquo;highly seasoned&rdquo; and &ldquo;rich&rdquo; food, and who,
craving for &ldquo;something plain&rdquo; proceed to inundate perfectly good, plain roast
or boiled dishes with a deluge of any of the afore-mentioned commercial &ldquo;sauces&rdquo;
that have absolutely no relation to the dish and that have no mission other than
to grant relief from the deadening monotony of &ldquo;plain&rdquo; food. Chicken or
mutton, beef or venison, finnan haddie or brook trout, eggs or oysters thus
&ldquo;sauced,&rdquo; taste all alike&mdash;sauce! To use such ready-made sauces with dishes
cooked <i>&agrave; l&rsquo;anglaise</i> is logical, excusable, almost advisable. Even the most ascetic
of men cannot resist the insidiousness of spicy delights, nor can he for any
length of time endure the insipidity of plain food sans sauce. Hence the popularity
of such sauces amongst people who do not observe the correct culinary
principle of seasoning food judiciously, befitting its character, without spoiling
but rather in enhancing its characteristics and in bringing out its flavor at the
right time, namely during coction to give the kindred aromas a chance to blend
well.</p>

<p>Continental nations, adhering to this important principle of cookery (inherited
from Apicius) would not dream of using ready-made (English) sauces.</p>

<p>We have witnessed real crimes being perpetrated upon perfectly seasoned and
delicately flavored <i>entr&eacute;es</i>. We have watched ill-advised people maltreat good
things, cooked to perfection, even before they tasted them, sprinkling them as a
matter of habit, with quantities of salt and pepper, paprika, cayenne, daubing
them with mustards of every variety or swamping them with one or several of
the commercial sauce preparations. &ldquo;Temperamental&rdquo; chefs, men who know
their art, usually explode at the sight of such wantonness. Which painter would
care to see his canvas varnished with all the hues in the rainbow by a patron
afflicted with such a taste?</p>

<p>Perhaps the craving for excessive flavoring is an olfactory delirium, a pathological
case, as yet unfathomed like the excessive craving for liquor, and, being
a problem for the medical fraternity, it is only of secondary importance to
gastronomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
To say that the Romans were afflicted on a national scale with a strange spice
mania (as some interpreters want us to believe) would be equivalent to the
assertion that all wine-growing nations were nations of drunkards. As a matter
of fact, the reverse is the truth.</p>

<p>Apicius surely would be surprised at some things we enjoy. <i>Voil&agrave;</i>, a recipe,
&ldquo;modern,&rdquo; not older than half a century, given by us in the Apician style or
writing: Take liquamen, pepper, cayenne, eggs, lemon, olive oil, vinegar, white
wine, anchovies, onions, tarragon, pickled cucumbers, parsley, chervil, hard-boiled
eggs, capers, green peppers, mustard, chop, mix well, and serve.</p>

<p>Do you recognize it? This formula sounds as phantastic, as &ldquo;weird&rdquo; and as
&ldquo;vile&rdquo; as any of the Apician concoctions, confusing even a well-trained cook
because we stated neither the title of this preparation nor the mode of making
it, nor did we name the ingredients in their proper sequence. This mystery was
conceived with an illustrative purpose which will be explained later, which may
and may not have to do with the mystery of Apicius. Consider, for a moment,
this mysterious creation No. 2: Take bananas, oranges, cherries, flavored with
bitter almonds, fresh pineapple, lettuce, fresh peaches, plums, figs, grapes, apples,
nuts, cream cheese, olive oil, eggs, white wine, vinegar, cayenne, lemon, salt,
white pepper, dry mustard, tarragon, rich sour cream, chop, mix, whip well.</p>

<p>Worse yet! Instead of having our appetite aroused the very perusal of this
quasi-Apician <i>mixtum compositum</i> repels every desire to partake of it. We are
justly tempted to condemn it as being utterly impossible. Yet every day hundreds
of thousand portions of it are sold under the name of special fruit salad
with <i>mayonnaise mousseuse</i>. The above mystery No. 1 is the justly popular
tartar sauce.</p>

<p>Thus we could go on analyzing modern preparations and make them appear
as outlandish things. Yet we relish them every day. The ingredients, obnoxious
in great quantities, are employed with common sense. We are not mystified
seeing them in print; they are usually given in clear logical order. This is not
the style of Apicius, however.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Latin Cunning</h3>

<p>We can hardly judge Apicius by what he has revealed but we rather should
try to discover what he&mdash;purposely or otherwise&mdash;has concealed if we would
get a good idea of the ancient kitchen. This thought occurred to us at the
eleventh hour, after years of study of the text and after almost despairing of a
plausible solution of its mysteries. And it seems surprising that Apicius has never
been suspected before of withholding information essential to the successful
practice of his rather hypothetical and empirical formul&aelig;. The more we scrutinize
them, the more we become convinced that the author has omitted vital
directions&mdash;same as we did purposely with the two modern examples above.
Many of the Apician recipes are dry enumerations of ingredients supposed to
belong to a given dish or sauce. It is well-known that in chemistry (cookery is
but applied chemistry) the knowledge of the rules governing the quantities and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the sequence of the ingredients, their manipulation, either separately or jointly,
either successively or simultaneously, is a very important matter, and that
violation or ignorance of the process may spell failure at any stage of the experiment.
In the kitchen this is particularly true of baking and soup and sauce
making, the most intricate of culinary operations.</p>

<p>There may have been two chief reasons for concealing necessary information.
Apicius, or more likely the professional collectors of the recipes, may have considered
technical elaboration of the formul&aelig; quite superfluous on the assumption
that the formul&aelig; were for professional use only. Every good practitioner
knows, with ingredients or components given, what manipulations are required,
what effects are desired. Even in the absence of detailed specifications, the experienced
practitioner will be able to divine correct proportions, by intuition.
As a matter of fact, in cookery the mention in the right place of a single ingredient,
like in poetry the right word, often suffices to conjure up before the
gourmet&rsquo;s mental eye vistas of delight. Call it inspiration, association of ideas
or what you please, a single word may often prove a guide, a savior.</p>

<p>Let us remember that in Apicii days paper (parchment, papyrus) and writing
materials were expensive and that, moreover, the ability of correct logical and
literary expression was necessarily limited in the case of a practising cook who,
after all, must have been the collector of the Apician formul&aelig;. This is sufficiently
proven by the <i>lingua coquinaria</i>, the vulgar Latin of our old work. In
our opinion, the ancient author did not consider it worth his while to give anything
but the most indispensable information in the tersest form. This he certainly
did. A comparison of his literary performance with that of the artistic
and accomplished writer of the Renaissance, Platina, will at once show up
Apicius as a hard-working practical cook, a man who knew his business but
who could not tell what he knew.</p>

<p>Like ever so many of his successors, he could not refrain from beginning and
concluding many of his articles with such superfluities as &ldquo;take this&rdquo; and &ldquo;And
serve,&rdquo; etc., all of which shows him up as a genuine cook. These articles, written
in the most laconic language possible&mdash;the language of a very busy, very
harassed, very hurried man, are the literary product of a cook, or several of
them.</p>

<p>The other chief motive for condensing or obscuring his text has a more subtle
foundation. Indeed, we are surprised that we should possess so great a collection
of recipes, representing to him who could use them certain commercial and
social value. The preservation of Apicius seems entirely accidental. Experienced
cooks were in demand in Apicii times; the valuation of their ministrations increased
proportionately to the progress in gastronomy and to the prosperity of
the nation. During Rome&rsquo;s frugal era, up to 200 B.C. the primitive cooks were
just slaves and household chattels; but the development of their trade into an
art, stimulated by foreign precepts, imported principally from Greece, Sicily and
Asia Minor, opened up to the practitioners not only the door to freedom from
servitude but it offered even positions of wealth with social and political standing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
often arousing the envy, satire, criticism of bona-fide politicians, journalists,
moralists, satirists and of the ever-present hordes of parasites and hangers-on.
Some cooks became confidants, even friends and advisors of men in high places,
emperors, (cf. life of Vitellius) and through their subtle influence upon the
mighty they may have contributed in no mean measure to the fate of the
nation. But such invisible string-pullers have not been confined to those days
alone. (Take Rasputin! Take the valet to William I, reputed to have had more
&ldquo;say&rdquo; than the mighty Bismarck, who, as it developed, got &ldquo;the air&rdquo; while the
valet died in his berth.)</p>

<p>Such being the case, what potential power reposed in a greasy cookery manuscript!
And, if so, why bare such wonderful secrets to Tom, Dick and Harry?</p>

<p>Weights and measures are given by Apicius in some instances. But just such
figures can be used artfully to conceal a trap. Any mediocre cook, gaining possession
of a choice collection of detailed and itemized recipes would have been
placed in an enviable position. Experimenting for some time (at his master&rsquo;s
expense) he would soon reach that perfection when he could demand a handsome
compensation for his ministrations. Throughout antique times, throughout
the middle ages down to the present day (when patent laws no longer protect a
secret) strict secrecy was maintained around many useful and lucrative formul&aelig;,
not only by cooks, but also by physicians, alchemists and the various scientists,
artisans and craftsmen. Only the favorite apprentice would be made heir to or
shareholder in this important stock in trade after his worthiness had been proven
to his master&rsquo;s satisfaction, usually by the payment of a goodly sum of money&mdash;apprentice&rsquo;s
pay. We remember reading in Lanciani (Rodolfo L.: Ancient Rome
in the Light of Recent Discoveries) how in the entire history of Rome there
is but one voice, that of a solitary, noble-minded physician, complaining about
the secrecy that was being maintained by his colleagues as regards their science.
To be sure, those fellows had every reason in the world for keeping quiet: so
preposterous were their methods in most cases! This secrecy indeed must have
carried with it a blessing in disguise. Professional reserve was not its object. The
motive was purely commercial.</p>

<p>Seeing where the information given by Apicius is out of reason and unintelligible
we are led to believe that such text is by no means to be taken very
literally. On the contrary, it is quite probable that weights and measures are
not correct: they are quite likely to be of an artful and studied unreliability. A
secret private code is often employed, necessitating the elimination or transposition
of certain words, figures or letters before the whole will become intelligible
and useful. If by any chance an uninitiated hand should attempt to
grasp such veiled directions, failure would be certain. We confess to have employed
at an early stage of our own career this same strategy and time-honored
camouflage to protect a precious lot of recipes. Promptly we lost this unctuous
manuscript, as we feared we would; if not deciphered today, the book has long
since been discarded as being a record of the ravings of a madman.</p>

<p>The advent of the printing press changed the situation. With Platina, ca.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
1474, an avalanche of cookery literature started. The secrets of Scappi, &ldquo;<i>cuoco
secreto</i>&rdquo; to the pope, were &ldquo;scooped&rdquo; by an enterprising Venetian printer in
1570. The guilds of French mustard makers and sauce cooks (precursors of
modern food firms and manufacturers of ready-made condiments) were a powerful
tribe of secret mongers in the middle ages. English gastronomic literature
of the 16th, 17th and even the 18th century is crowded with &ldquo;closets opened,&rdquo;
&ldquo;secrets let out&rdquo; and other alluring titles purporting to regale the prospective
reader with profitable and appetizing secrets of all sorts. Kitchen secrets became
commercial articles.</p>

<p>These remarks should suffice to illustrate the assumption that the Apicius book
was not created for publication but that it is a collection of abridged formul&aelig;
for private use, a treasure chest as it were, of some cook, which after the demise
of its owner, collector, originator, a curious world could not resist to play with, although
but a few experienced masters held the key, being able to make use
of the recipes.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Meat Diet</h3>

<p>In perusing Apicius only one or two instances of cruelty to animals have
come to our attention (cf. recipes No. <a href="#r140">140</a> and <a href="#r259">259</a>). Cruel methods of slaughter
were common. Some of the dumb beasts that were to feed man and even
had to contribute to his pleasures and enjoyment of life by giving up their own
lives often were tortured in cruel, unspeakable ways. The belief existed that
such methods might increase the quality, palatability and flavor of the meat.
Such beliefs and methods may still be encountered on the highways and byways
in Europe and Asia today. Since the topic, strictly speaking does not belong
here, we cannot depict it in detail, and in passing make mention of it to refer
students interested in the psychology of the ancients to such details as are found
in the writings of Plutarch and other ancient writers during the early Christian
era. It must be remembered, however, that such writers (including the irreproachable
Plutarch) were advocates of vegetarianism. Some passages are inspired
by true humane feeling, but much appears to be written in the interest
of vegetarianism.</p>

<p>The ancients were not such confirmed meat eaters as the modern Western
nations, merely because the meat supply was not so ample. Beef was scarce
because of the shortage of large pastures. The cow was sacred, the ox furnished
motive power, and, after its usefulness was gone, the muscular old brute had
little attraction for the gourmet. Today lives a race of beef eaters. Our beef
diet, no doubt is bound to change somewhat. Already the world&rsquo;s grazing
grounds are steadily diminishing. The North American prairies are being parcelled
off into small farms the working conditions of which make beef raising
expensive. The South American pampas and a strip of coastal land in Australia
now furnish the bulk of the world&rsquo;s beef supply. Perhaps Northern Asia still
holds in store a large future supply of meat but this no doubt will be claimed by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Asia. Already North America is acclimating the Lapland reindeer to offset the
waning beef, to utilize its Northern wastes.</p>

<p>With the increasing shortage of beef, with the increasing facilities for raising
chicken and pork, a reversion to Apician methods of cookery and diet is not only probably
but actually seems inevitable. The ancient bill of fare and the ancient
methods of cookery were entirely guided by the supply of raw materials&mdash;precisely
like ours. They had no great food stores nor very efficient marketing and
transportation systems, food cold storage. They knew, however, to take care of
what there was. They were good managers.</p>

<p>Such atrocities as the willful destruction of huge quantities of food of every
description on the one side and starving multitudes on the other as seen today
never occurred in antiquity.</p>

<p>Many of the Apician dishes will not appeal to the beef eaters. It is worthy of
note that much criticism was heaped upon Apicius some 200 years ago in
England when beef eating became fashionable in that country. The art of
Apicius requires practitioners of superior intellect. Indeed, it requires a superior
client&egrave;le to appreciate Apician dishes. But practitioners that would pass the requirements
of the Apician school are scarce in the kitchens of the beef eaters.
We cannot blame meat eaters for rejecting the average <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> set before
them by a mediocre cook who has learned little besides the roasting or broiling
of meats. Once the average man has acquired a taste for the refined compositions
made by a talented and experienced cook, say, a composition of meats, vegetables
or cereals, properly &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; by that intuition that never fails the real artist,
the fortunate diner will eventually curtail the preponderant meat diet. A glance
at some Chinese and Japanese methods of cookery may perhaps convince us of
the probability of these remarks.</p>

<p>Nothing is more perplexing and more alarming than a new dish, but we can
see in a reversion to Apician cookery methods only a dietetic benefit accruing
to this so-called white race of beef eaters.</p>

<p>Apicius certainly excels in the preparation of vegetable dishes (cf. his
cabbage and asparagus) and in the utilization of parts of food materials that
are today considered inferior, hardly worth preparing for the table except by
the very careful and economical housekeeper. Properly prepared, many of these
things are good, often more nutritious than the dearer cuts, and sometimes they
are really delicious.</p>

<p>One has but to study the methods of ancient and intelligent people who have
suffered for thousands of years under the perennial shortage of food supplies in
order to understand and to appreciate Apician methods. Be it far from us to
advocate their methods, or to wish upon us the conditions that engendered such
methods; for such practices have been pounded into these people by dire necessity.
They have graduated from the merciless school of hunger.</p>

<p>Food materials, we repeat, were never as cheap and as abundant as they are
today. But who can say that they always will be so in the future?</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="smcap">Science Confirming Ancient Methods</h3>

<p>We must not overlook the remarkable intuition displayed by the ancients in
giving preference to foods with body-&nbsp;and blood-building properties. For instance,
the use of liver, particularly fish liver already referred to. The correctness
of their choice is now being confirmed by scientific re-discoveries. The young
science of nutrition is important enough to an individual who would stimulate
or preserve his health. But since constitutions are different, the most carefully
conceived dietary may apply to one particular individual only, provided, however,
that our present knowledge of nutrition be correct and final. This knowledge,
as a matter of fact, is being revised and changed constantly.</p>

<p>If dietetics, therefore, were important enough to have any bearing at all upon
the well-defined methods of cookery, we might go into detail analyzing ancient
methods from that point of view. To call attention to the &ldquo;economy,&rdquo; the
stewardship, or craftsmanship, in ancient methods and to the truly remarkable
intuition that guided the ancient cooks is more important. Without these
qualities there can be no higher gastronomy. Without high gastronomy no high
civilization is possible. The honest and experienced nutrition expert, though
perhaps personally opposed to elaborate dining, will discover through close study
of the ancient precepts interesting pre-scientific and well-balanced combinations
and methods designed to jealously guard the vitamins and dietetic values in
dishes that may appear curiously &ldquo;new&rdquo; to the layman that would nevertheless
receive the unqualified approval of modern science.</p>

<p>We respect the efforts of modern dietitians and food reformers; but we are
far removed from the so-called &ldquo;simple&rdquo; and &ldquo;plain&rdquo; foods advocated by some
well-meaning individuals. With the progress of civilization we are farther and
farther drifting away from it. Even barbaric and beastly food is not &ldquo;simple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This furtive &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in cookery (in the absence of scientific facts because
of the inability of cooks to transform empirical traditions into practical rules
emanating from understood principles) still prevails today. It guides great chefs,
saves time spent in scientific study.</p>

<p>The much criticized &ldquo;unnatural union of sugar and meats&rdquo; of the ancients
still exists today in many popular examples of cookery: lamb and mint sauce,
steak and catsup, mutton and currant jelly, pork and apples (in various forms),
oyster cocktail, poultry and comp&ocirc;te, goose with apple and raisin dressing, venison
and Cumberland sauce, mince pie, plum pudding&mdash;typical survivals of
ancient traditions. &ldquo;Intuition&rdquo; is still preceding exact science, and &ldquo;unnatural
unions&rdquo; as in social, political and any other form of life, seem to be the rule
rather than the exception.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Disguising Foods</h3>

<p>Apicius is often blamed for his endeavor to serve one thing under the guise of
another. The reasons for such deceptions are various ones. Fashion dictated it.
Cooks were not considered &ldquo;clever&rdquo; unless they could surprise guests with a
commonplace food material so skillfully prepared that identification was difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or impossible. Another reason was the absence of good refrigeration, making
&ldquo;masking&rdquo; necessary. Also the ambition of hosts to serve a cheaper food for a
more expensive one&mdash;veal for chicken, pork for partridge, and so on. But do
we not indulge in the same &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; today? We either do it with the intention
of deceiving or to &ldquo;show off.&rdquo; Have we not &ldquo;Mock Turtle Soup,&rdquo; <i>Mouton &agrave; la
Chasseur</i>, mutton prepared to taste like venison, &ldquo;chicken&rdquo; salad made of veal
or of rabbit? In Europe even today much of the traditional roast hare is caught
in the alley, and it belongs to a feline species. &ldquo;Roof hare.&rdquo;</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Food Adulterations</h3>

<p>There is positive evidence of downright frauds and vicious food adulteration
in the times of Apicius. The old rascal himself is not above giving directions
for rose wine without roses, or how to make a spoiled honey marketable, and
other similar adulterations. Those of our readers with sensitive gastronomic
instinct had better skip the paragraphs discussing the treatment of &ldquo;birds with
a goatish smell.&rdquo; But the old food adulterators are no match for their modern
successors.</p>

<p>Too, some of our own shams are liable to misinterpretation. In centuries to
come our own modern recipes for &ldquo;Scotch Woodcock&rdquo; or &ldquo;Welsh rabbit&rdquo; may
be interpreted as attempts on our part to hoodwink guests by making game
birds and rabbits out of cheese and bread, like Trimalchio&rsquo;s culinary artists are
reputed to have made suckling pigs out of dough, partridges of veal, chicken of
tunny fish, and <i>vice versa</i>. What indeed would a serious-minded research worker
a thousand years hence if unfamiliar with our culinary practice and traditions
make of such terms as <i>pette de nonne</i> as found in many old French cookery
books, or of the famous <i>suttelties</i> (subtleties)&mdash;the confections once so popular
at medieval weddings?</p>

<p>The ramifications of the <i>lingua coquinaria</i> in any country are manifold,
and the culinary wonderland is full of pitfalls even for the experienced gourmet.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Reaching the Limit</h3>

<p>Like in all other branches of ancient endeavor, cookery had reached a state of
perfection around the time of Apicius when the only chance for successful continuation
of the art lay in the conquest of new fields, i.e., in expansion, generalization,
elaboration and in influence from foreign sources. We have witnessed
this in French cookery which for the last hundred years has successfully expanded
and has virtually captured the civilized parts of the globe, subject however,
always to regional and territorial modifications.</p>

<p>This desirable expansion of antique cookery did not take place. It was violently
and rather suddenly checked principally by political and economic events
during the centuries following Apicius, perhaps principally by the forces that
caused the great migration (the very quest of food!). Suspension ensued instead.
The heirs to the ancient culture were not yet ready for their marvelous heritage.
Besides their cultural unpreparedness, the cookery of the ancients, like their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
humor, did not readily appeal to the &ldquo;Nordic&rdquo; heirs. Both are so subtle and they
depend so much upon the psychology and the economic conditions of a people,
and they thus presented almost unsurmountable obstacles to the invaders. Still
lo! already in the fifth century, the Goth Vinithaharjis, started to collect the
Apician precepts.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Our Predecessors</h3>

<p>The usefulness in our days of Apicius as a practical cookery book has been
questioned, but we leave this to our readers to decide after the perusal of this
translation.</p>

<p>If not useful in the kitchen, if we cannot grasp its moral, what, then, is
Apicius? Merely a curio?</p>

<p>The existing manuscripts cannot be bought; the old printed editions are
highly priced by collectors, and they are rare. Still, the few persons able to read
the messages therein cannot use them: they are not practitioners in cookery.</p>

<p>None of the Apician editors (except Danneil and the writer) were experienced
practising gastronomers. Humelbergius, Lister, Bernhold were medical
men. Two serious students, Schuch and Wuestemann, gave up academic positions
to devote a year to the study of modern cookery in order to be able to interpret
Apicius. These enthusiasts overlooked, however, two facts: Apicius cannot be
understood by inquiring into modern average cookery methods, nor can complete
mastery of cookery, practical as well as theoretical, including the historical
and physiological aspects of gastronomy be acquired in one year. Richard Gollmer,
another Apicius editor, declares that the results of this course in gastronomy
were negative. We might add here that Schuch&rsquo;s edition of Apicius, apart from
the unwarranted inclusion of the <i>excerpta</i> of Vinidarius is the least reliable of all
editions.</p>

<p>Gollmer published a free version of Apicius in German in 1909. If he did not
render the original very faithfully and literally, it must be said in all fairness
that his methods of procedure were correct. Gollmer attempted to interpret the
ancient text for the modern reader. Unfortunately he based his work upon that
of Schuch and Wuestemann and Lister. A year or so later Eduard Danneil
published a version of his own, also based on Schuch. This editor is a practising
<i>chef</i>,&mdash;<i>Hof-Traiteur</i> or caterer to the court of one of the then reigning princes
of Germany. Danneil&rsquo;s preface is dated 1897, though the date of publication
is 1911. In view of the fact that Gollmer had covered the ground and that
Danneil added nothing new to Apician lore, his publication seems superfluous.
Danneil&rsquo;s translation differs in that the translator adhered literally to the questionable
Schuch version whereas Gollmer aspired to a free and readable version
for an educated public.</p>

<p>A comparison reveals that the one author is not a cook while the other
is not a savant.</p>

<p>Like the scholars who tried their hand at cookery, there are a number of
worthy and ambitious practitioners of cookery who have endeavored to reach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the heights of scholarship, among them Car&ecirc;me and Soyer, men of great calibre.
Unfortunately, the span of human life is short, the capacity of the human
mind is limited. Fruitful achievements in widely different fields of endeavor
by one man are rare. This is merely to illustrate the extreme difficulty encountered
by anyone bent on a venturesome exploration of our subject and the very
narrow chances of success to extricate himself with grace from the two-thousand
year old labyrinth of philosophical, historical, linguistical and gastronomical
technicalities.</p>

<p>This task will become comparatively easy, however, and surely interesting and
with a foreboding of many delights and surprises if we penetrate the jungle
aided by the experience of predecessors, steadfastly relying on the &ldquo;theory of
evolution&rdquo; as a guide, and armed with the indispensable equipment for gastronomical
research, i.e., the practical and technical knowledge of cookery,
mastery of languages, augmented by practical experience gathered by observations
and travel in many lands, and last but not least, if we are obsessed with
the fixed idea that so menial a subject is worth all the bother.</p>

<p>We have purposely refrained from presenting here a treatise in the customary
scientific style. We know, there are repetitions, digressions, excursions into
adjacent fields that may be open to criticism. We really do not aim to make
this critical review an exhibition of scholarly attainments with all the necessary
brevity, clarity, scientific restraint and etiquette. Such style would be entirely
out of our line. Any bookish flavor attaching itself to our work would soon
replace a natural fragrance we aim to preserve, namely our close contact with
the subject. Those interested in the scholarly work that has been contributed
to this cause are referred to modern men like Vollmer, Giarratano, Brandt and
others named in the bibliography. Of the older scientists there is Martinus
Lister, a man whose knowledge of the subject is very respectable and whose devotion
to it is unbounded, whose integrity as a scientist is above reproach. His
notes and commentaries together with those of Humelbergius, the editor-physician
of Z&uuml;rich, will be enjoyed and read with profit by every antiquary. The
labors of Bernhold and Schuch are meritorious also, the work, time, and <i>esprit</i>
these men have devoted to the subject is enormous. As for Torinus, the opinions
are divided. Humelbergius ignores him, Gryphius pirates him, Lister scorns him,
we like him. Lister praises his brother physician, Humelbergius: <i>Doctus quidem
vir et modestus!</i> So he is! The notes by Humelbergius alone and his word: <i>Nihil
immutare ausi summus!</i> entitles him to all the praise Lister can bestow. Unfortunately,
the sources of his information are unknown.</p>

<p>Lacking these, we have of course no means of ascertaining whether he always
lived up to his word that he is not privileged to change. Humelbergius and
Lister may have made contributions of value from a philological point of view
but their work appears to have less merit gastronomically than that of Torinus.
To us the Basel editor often seems surprisingly correct in cases where the gastronomical
character of a formula is in doubt.</p>

<p>In rendering the ancient text into English we, too, have endeavored to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Humelbergii example; hence the almost literal translation of the originals before
us, namely, Torinus, Humelbergius, Lister, Bernhold, Schuch and the latest,
Giarratano-Vollmer which reached us in 1925 in time for collating. We have
wavered often and long whether or not to place alongside this English version
the original Latin text, but due to the divergencies we have finally abandoned
the idea, for practical reasons alone.</p>

<p>In translating we have endeavored to clear up mysteries and errors; this interpretation
is a work quite apart and independent of that of the translation.
It is merely the sum and substance of our practical experience in gastronomy. It is
not to be taken as an attempt to change the original but is presented in good
faith, to be taken on its face value. This interpretation appears in the form of
notes directly under each article, for quick reference and it is our wish that it
be of some practical service in contributing to the general understanding and
appreciation of our ancient book.</p>

<p>For the sake of expediency we have numbered and placed a title (in English)
on each ancient recipe, following the example of Schuch. This procedure may be
counted against us as a liberty taken with the text. The text has remained inviolate.
We have merely aimed at a rational and legible presentation&mdash;work
within the province and the duty of an editor-translator and technical expert.</p>

<p>We do not claim credit for any other work connected with the task of making
this most unique book accessible to the English speaking public and for the
competition for scholastic laurels we wish to stay <i>hors de combat</i>. We feel we
are not privileged to pass final judgment upon the excellent work done by sympathetic
and erudite admirers of our ancient book throughout the better part of
four centuries, and we cannot side with one or the other in questions philological,
historical, or of any other nature, except gastronomical. We are deeply indebted
to all of our predecessors and through conversations and extensive correspondence
with other modern researchers, Dr. Edward Brandt and Dr. Margaret B.
Wilson, we are enabled to predict new developments in Apician research. The
debates of the scientists, it appears, are not yet closed.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the various differences of opinion in minor questions are
of little import to us as compared with the delightful fact that we here possess
an Apicius, not only a genuine Roman, but an &ldquo;honest-to-goodness&rdquo; human
being besides. A jolly fellow is Apicius with a basketful of happy messages for a
hungry world. We therefore want to make this work of ours the entertainment
and instruction the subject deserves to be. If we succeed in proving that Apicius
is not a mummified, bone-dry classic but that he has &ldquo;the goods,&rdquo; namely some
real human merit we shall have accomplished more than the savants to whom
this popularization of our hero has been denied so far.</p>

<p>After all, we live in a practical age, and it is the practical value, the matter-of-fact
contribution to our happiness and well-being by the work of any man,
ancient or modern, which counts in these days of materialism.</p>

<p>So let us tell the truth, and let us sum up in a few words:</p>

<p>We do not know who Apicius is. We do not know who wrote the book bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
his name. We do not know when it was written, or whether it is of Greek or
of Roman origin. Furthermore, we do not understand many of its precepts!</p>

<p>We do know, however, that it is the oldest work dealing with the food and
the cookery of the ancient world&rsquo;s greatest empire, and that, as such, it is of the
utmost interest and importance to us.</p>

<p>In this sense we have endeavored to treat the book.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Dining in Apician Style</h3>

<p>Past attempts to dine &agrave; l&rsquo;Apicius invariably have ended disastrously. Eager
<i>gourmets</i>, ever on the look-out for something new, and curious scholars have
attempted to prepare dishes in the manner prescribed by Apicius. Most of such
experimenters have executed the old precepts literally, instead of trying to enter
into their spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Das Land der Griechen mit der Seele suchen!</i>&rdquo; says Goethe. The friends of
Apicius who failed to heed this advice, also failed to comprehend the precepts,
they were cured of their curiosity, and blamed the master for their own shortcomings.
Christina, queen of Sweden, was made ill by an attempt of this kind to
regale her majesty with a rare Apician morsel while in Italy as the guest of
some noble. But history is dark on this point. Here perhaps Apicius is blamed
for a dastardly attempt on the royal lady&rsquo;s life for this daughter of the Protestant
Gustavus Adolphus was in those days not the only crowned head in danger of
being dispatched by means of some tempting morsel smilingly proffered by some
titled rogue. A deadly dish under the disguise of &ldquo;Apicius&rdquo; must have been
particularly convenient in those days for such sinister purposes. The sacred
obligations imposed upon &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; by the virtue of hospitality had been
often forgotten by the super-refined hosts of the Renaissance.</p>

<p>But Apicius continued to prove unhealthful to a number of later amateurs.
Lister, with his perfectly sincere endeavor to popularize Apicius, achieved precisely
the opposite. The publication of his work in London, 1705, was the signal
for a number of people, scholars and others, to crack jokes, not at the expense
of Apicius, as they imagined, but to expose their own ignorance. Smollet, Dr.
W. King (&ldquo;Poor starving wit&rdquo;&mdash;Swift), Dr. Hunter and others. More recently,
a party of English dandies, chaperoned, if we remember correctly, by the ponderous
George Augustus Sala, fared likewise badly in their attempt to stage a
Roman feast, being under the impression that the days of Tiberius and the mid-Victorian
era may be joined with impunity, <i>&agrave; la minute</i>, as it were.</p>

<p>Even later, in one of the (alas! not so many) good books on gastronomy,
&ldquo;Kettner&rsquo;s Book of the Table,&rdquo; London, 1877, the excellent author dismisses
Roman cookery with a few lines of &ldquo;warning.&rdquo; Kettner, admirer of Sala, evidently
was still under the baneful influence. Twenty years later, Danneil, colleague
of Kettner&rsquo;s, joined the chorus of &ldquo;irreverent critics.&rdquo; They all based
their judgment on mere idle conversation, resulting from disappointments in
ill-fated attempts to cook in the Apician style. Even the best experts, it appears,
fall victims to the mysterious spell surrounding, protecting things of sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
antiquity, hovering like an avenging angel over them, to ward off all &ldquo;irreverent
critics&rdquo; and curious intruders.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Proof of the Pudding</h3>

<p>After all, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. This homely solid wisdom
is literally true of our good old Apicius. We have tested many of his precepts,
and have found them practical, good, even delightful. A few, we will say, are
of the rarest beauty and of consummate perfection in the realm of gastronomy,
while some others again are totally unintelligible for reasons sufficiently explained.
Always remembering Humelbergius, we have &ldquo;laid off&rdquo; of these torsos,
recommending them to some more competent commentator. Many of the ancient
formula tried have our unqualified gastronomic approval.</p>

<p>If our work has not differed from that of our predecessors, if it shows the
same human frailties and foibles, we have at least one mark of distinction among
the editors in that we have subjected the original to severe practical tests as much
as this is possible with our modern food materials. We experienced difficulty in
securing certain spices long out of use. Nevertheless, the experience of actually
sampling Apician dishes and the sensation of dining in the manners of the
C&aelig;sars are worth the trouble we took with Apicius. This is a feeling of partaking
of an entirely new dish, met with both expectancy and with suspicion, accentuated
by the hallowed traditions surrounding it which has rewarded us for the
time and expense devoted to the subject. Ever since we have often dined in
the classical fashion of the ancients who, after all, were but &ldquo;folks&rdquo; like ourselves.</p>

<p>If you care not for the carnal pleasures in Apician gastronomy&mdash;for <i>gulam</i>,&mdash;if
you don&rsquo;t give a fig for philology, there still is something healthy, something
infinitely soothing and comforting&mdash;&ldquo;educational&rdquo;&mdash;in the perusal of
the old book and in similar records.</p>

<p>When we see Apicius, the famous &ldquo;epicure&rdquo; descending to the very level of a
common food &ldquo;fakir,&rdquo; giving directions for making Liburnian oil that has
never seen that country....</p>

<p>When we note, with a gentle shudder, that the grafters of Naples, defying
even the mighty Augustus, leveled the &ldquo;White Earth Hill&rdquo; near Puteoli because
an admixture of plaster paris is exceedingly profitable to the milling profession....</p>

<p>When Apicius&mdash;celebrated glutton&mdash;resorts to the comparatively harmless
&ldquo;stunt&rdquo; of keeping fresh vegetables green by boiling them in a copper kettle
with soda....</p>

<p>When we behold hordes of ancient legislators, posing as dervishes of moderation,
secretly and openly breaking the prohibition laws of their own making....</p>

<p>When we turn away from such familiar sights and, in a more jovial mood,
heartily laugh at the jokes of that former mill slave, Plautus (who could not
pay his bills) and when we wonder why his wise cracks sound so familiar we
remember that we have heard their modern versions only yesterday at the
Tivoli on State Street....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
When, finally, in the company of our respected Horatius we hear him say in
the slang of his day: <i>Ab ovo usque ad mala</i>, and compare this bright saying with
our own dear &ldquo;From Soup to Nuts.&rdquo;...</p>

<p>Then we arrive at the comforting conclusion that we moderns are either very
ancient and backward or that indeed the ancients are very modern and progressive;
and it is our only regret that we cannot decide this perplexing situation to
our lasting satisfaction.</p>

<p>Very true, there may be nothing new under the sun, yet nature goes on
eternally fashioning new things from old materials. Eternally demolishing old
models in a manner of an economical sculptor, nature uses the same old clay
to create new specimens. Sometimes nature slightly alters the patterns, discarding
what is unfit for her momentary enigmatic purposes, retaining and favoring
that which pleases her whimsical fancy for the time being.</p>

<p>Cookery deals exclusively with nature&rsquo;s works. Books on cookery are essentially
books on nature&rsquo;s actions and reactions.</p>

<p>In the perpetual search for perfection, life has accomplished one remarkable
thing: the development of man, the animal which cooks. Gradually nature has
revealed herself to man principally through the food he takes, cooks and prepares
for the enjoyment of himself and his fellow men.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">The Cooking Animal</h3>

<p>The gastronomer is the highest development of the cooking animal.</p>

<p>He&mdash;artist, philosopher, metaphysician, religionist&mdash;stands with his head
bared before nature: overawed, contemplating her gifts, feasting his eyes on
beauteous forms and colors, inhaling intoxicating fragrances, aromas, odors,
matching them all artistically, partaking only of what he needs for his own subsistence&mdash;eternally
marveling at nature&rsquo;s inexhaustible resources and inventiveness,
at her everlasting bounty born of everlasting fierce struggles.</p>

<p>The gastronomer is grateful for the privilege of holding the custodianship of
such precious things, and he guards it like an office of a sacred rite&mdash;ever gratefully,
reverently adoring, cherishing the things before him ... ever marveling
... ever alone, alone with nature.</p>

<p>As for the overwhelming majority of the cooking animals, they behave much
more &ldquo;naturally.&rdquo; They are a merry crowd, ever anticipating a good time, ever
jolly, eager, greedy. Or, they are cranky, hungry, starved, miserable, and they
turn savage now and then. Some are gluttonous. Many contract indigestion&mdash;nature&rsquo;s
most subtle punishment.</p>

<p>If they were told that they must kill before they may cook&mdash;that might
spoil the appetite and dinner joy of many a tender-hearted devourer of fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Heaven forbid! Being real children of nature, and behaving naturally, nature
likes them, and we, too, certainly are well pleased with the majority.</p>

<p>The only fly in the ointment of life is that we don&rsquo;t know what it is all about,
and probably never will know.</p>

pungent laser flavor [by some believed to be <i>asa foetida</i>] because it was very expensive,
but principally because the Roman cooks worked economically and
knew how to treat spices and flavors judiciously. This article alone should disperse
for all time all stories of ancient Rome&rsquo;s extravagance in flavoring and
seasoning dishes. It reminds of the methods used by European cooks to get the
utmost use out of the expensive vanilla bean: they bury the bean in a can of
powdered sugar. They will use the sugar only which has soon acquired a delicate
vanilla perfume, and will replace the used sugar by a fresh supply. This is by far
a superior method to using the often rank and adulterated &ldquo;vanilla extract&rdquo; readily
bottled. It is more gastronomical and more economical. Most commercial
extracts are synthetic, some injurious. To believe that any of them impart to the
dishes the true flavor desired is of course ridiculous. The enormous consumption
of such extracts however, is characteristic of our industrialized barbarism which
is so utterly indifferent to the fine points in food. Today it is indeed hard for the
public to obtain a real vanilla bean.</p>

or, adding bouillon, tie same with a little flour and butter, and would call the
dish Stewed Celery and Leeks. The ancient method is entirely rational because
the mineral salts of the vegetables are preserved and utilized (invariably observed

by Apicius) which today are often wasted by inexperienced cooks who discard
these precious elements with the water in which vegetables are boiled.</p>

<a name="r72" id="r72"></a>[72] ASPARAGUS</span>
<i>ASPARAGOS</i></p>

<p>ASPARAGUS [Tor. IN ORDER TO HAVE IT MOST AGREEABLE
TO THE PALATE] MUST BE [peeled, washed and] DRIED
[1] AND IMMERSED IN BOILING WATER BACKWARDS [2]
[3].</p>

<p class="note">[1] V. Must be dried before boiling because the cold water clinging to the
stalks is likely to chill the boiling water too much in which the asparagus is to
be cooked. Apicius here reveals himself as the consummate cook who is familiar
with the finest detail of physical and chemical changes which food undergoes at
varying temperatures.</p>

<p class="note">The various editions all agree: <i>asparagos siccabis</i>; Schuch, however, says: &ldquo;For
the insane <i>siccabis</i> I substitute <i>siciabis</i>, <i>isiciabis</i>, prepare with <i>sicio</i> [?] and cook.&rdquo;
He even goes on to interpret it <i>cucabis</i> from the Greek <i>kouki</i>, cocoanut milk,
and infers that the asparagus was first cooked in cocoanut milk and then put
back into water, a method we are tempted to pronounce insane.</p>

<p class="note">[2] V. Backwards! G.-V. <i>rursum in calidam</i>; Tac. <i>rursus in aquam calidam</i>;
Tor. <i>ac rursus ...</i></p>

<p class="note">This word has caused us some reflection, but the ensuing discovery made it
worth while. <i>Rursus</i> has escaped the attention of the other commentators. In this
case <i>rursus</i> means backwards, being a contraction from <i>revorsum</i>, h.e. <i>reversum</i>.
The word is important enough to be observed.</p>

<p class="note">Apicius evidently has the right way of cooking the fine asparagus. The stalks,
after being peeled and washed must be bunched together and tied according to
sizes, and the bunches must be set into the boiling water &ldquo;backwards,&rdquo; that is,
they must stand upright with the heads protruding from the water. The heads
will be made tender above the water line by rising steam and will be done simultaneously
with the harder parts of the stalks. We admit, we have never seen a
modern cook observe this method. They usually boil the tender heads to death
while the lower stalks are still hard.</p>

<p class="note">Though this formula is incomplete (it fails to state the sauce to be served, also
that the asparagus must be peeled and bunched, that the water must contain
salt, etc.) it is one of the neatest formul&aelig; in Apicius. It is amusing to note how
the author herein unconsciously reveals what a poor lit&eacute;rateur but what a fine
cook he is. This is characteristic of most good practitioners. One may perfectly
master the vast subject of cookery, yet one may not be able to give a definition
of even a single term, let alone the ability to exactly describe one of the many
processes of cookery. Real poets often are in the same predicament; none of
them ever explained the art satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="note">[3] G.-V. add to the formula <i>callosiores reddes</i>&mdash;give back [eliminate] the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
harder ones. This sentence belongs to the next article. And Torinus, similar to
Humelbergius, renders this sentence <i>ut reddas ad gustum calliores</i>&mdash;to render
the harder ones palatable&mdash;the squash and pumpkin namely&mdash;and we are
inclined to agree with him.</p>

[3] A panada as is found in every old cookery book. Today it remains as a
dressing for roast fowl, etc. Quoting from &ldquo;A Collection of Receipts in Cookery,
Physick and Surgery,&rdquo; London, 1724:</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Panada for a Sick or Weak Stomach. Put the crumbs of a Penny White-Loaf
grated into a Quart of cold Water, set both on the Fire together with a blade
of Mace: When &rsquo;tis boil&rsquo;d smooth, take it off the fire and put in a bit of Lemon-peel,
the juice of a Lemon, a glass of Sack [Spanish Wine] and Sugar to your
Taste. This is very Nourishing and never offends the Stomach. Some season with
butter and Sugar, adding Currants which on some occasions are proper; but the
first is the most grateful and innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">Mrs. Glasse, a quarter century later, in her famous book [The Art of Cookery
Made Plain and Easy, London, 1747, 1st ed.] omits the wine, but Mrs. Mason, at
about the same time, insists on having it with panada.</p>

of eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger&mdash;spices which the insipid pumpkin
needs. The ancient original may have omitted the eggs because Apicius probably
expected his formula to be carried out in accordance with the preceding

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
article opens with the following sentence: <i>patin de abua sive apua sic facies</i>. He
is therefore quite emphatic that the dish is to be made with the <i>abua</i> or <i>apua</i> (an
anchovy) and not without <i>apua</i>, as List. has it. Lan. calls the dish: P. <i>de apabadiade</i>,
not identified.</p>

with the eggs, i.e. beware of boiling them for they will curdle, and the experiment

(!) It is quite plain that Tor. has the correct formula.</p>

<p class="note">[3] <i>et ex esu nemo agnoscet quid manducet.</i> Dann. renders this sentence
thus: &ldquo;Nobody can value this dish unless he has partaken of it himself.&rdquo; He is
too lenient. We would rather translate it literally as we did above, or say broadly,
&ldquo;And nobody will be any the wiser.&rdquo; List. dwells at length upon this sentence;
his erudite commentary upon the <i>cena dubia</i>, the doubtful meal, will be
found under the heading of <i>cena</i> in our vocabulary. List. pp. 126-7. List. undoubtedly
made the mistake of reading <i>sine</i> for <i>sive</i>. He therefore omitted the
<i>apua</i> from his formula. The above boastful sentence may have induced him to
do so.</p>

<p class="note">The above is a fish forcemeat, now seldom used as an integral dish, but still
popular as a dressing for fish or as quenelles. The modern fish forcemeat is usually
made of raw fish, cream and eggs, with the necessary seasoning. The

The oil seems superfluous, but it is taking the place of our butter. This

Sea; a malicious fish with a mouth similar to a rabbit&rdquo;; Dann. thinks it is a
sturgeon, but in Goll. it appears as tunny. The ancients called the sturgeon
<i>acipenser</i>; but this name was gradually changed into <i>styrio</i>, <i>stirio</i> and <i>sturio</i>,
which is similar to <i>tursio</i> (cf. <a href="#styrio"><i>styrio</i></a> in the vocabulary). The fish in question

<p class="note">The above is an excellent way of making fish balls, it being taken for granted,
of course, that the salt fish be thoroughly soaked and cooked in milk before
shaping into balls. The many spices should be used very moderately, some to be
omitted entirely. We read between the lines of the old formula that the <i>Tursio</i>
had a long journey from Pontus to Rome; fish however dry acquires a notorious
flavor upon such journeys which must be offset by herbs and spices.</p>

<p class="note">It is quite possible that the ancients made a <i>r&eacute;duction</i> of the herbs and spices
mentioned in this formula; in fact, the presence of vinegar leads us to believe
this, in which case this formula would be nothing but a very modern sauce. The
herbs and spices in a <i>r&eacute;duction</i> are crushed and boiled down in vinegar and wine,

removed by an operation when the cock is young. This operation is said to have
been first performed by a Roman surgeon with the intention of beating the <i>Lex
Fannia</i>, or Fannian law, sponsored by a fanatic named Fannius. It prohibited
among other restrictions the serving of any fowl at any time or repast except a
hen, and this hen was not to be fattened. Note the cunning of the law: The
useful hen and her unlaid eggs could be sacrificed while the unproductive
rooster was allowed to thrive to no purpose, immune from the butcher&rsquo;s block.
This set the shrewd surgeon to thinking; he transformed a rooster into a capon
by his surgical trick. The emasculated bird grew fat without his owner committing
any infraction of the Roman law against fattening chickens. Of course the
capon, being neither hen nor rooster, was perfectly safe to eat, for he was within
the law. Thus he became a huge success as an ancient &ldquo;bootleg&rdquo; chicken.</p>

<p class="note">[1] G.-V. <i>m. ex citriis</i>.</p>

<p class="note">[2] At this late point Apicius commences to use the term <i>coctura</i> which does
not designate any particular ingredient but rather stands for a certain process
of cookery, depending upon the ingredients used in the dish. We would here
interpret it as the frying of the leeks in oil, etc. In another instance <i>coctura</i> may
mean our modern <i>r&eacute;duction</i>.</p>

<p class="note">[3] The fruit to be used here has not been satisfactorily identified. The texts
have <i>citrium</i> and <i>citrum</i>&mdash;a sweet squash or cucumber&mdash;perhaps even a
melon, but not the citron, the <i>mala citrea</i> as read by List. This specimen is hard
to identify because of the many varieties in the cucumber, squash and the citrus
families. <i>Citrus</i>, as a matter of fact, is but a corruption of <i>cedrus</i>, the cedar tree.</p>

<p class="note">We are not sure whether this fruit is to be stuffed with the ragout and then
baked, as is often the custom to do with such shells; the texts prescribes distinctly
to hollow out the fruit.</p>

<p class="note">The title, implying a &ldquo;sweet dish&rdquo; is obviously wrong.</p>

<p class="note">It may be remarked here that Apicius makes no mention of that marvelous
citrus fruit, the lemon, nor of the orange, both of which are indispensable to
modern cookery.</p>

an idea that was much ridiculed in England after the publication of Lister&rsquo;s
work in 1705.</p>

<p class="note">We concur with Schuch&rsquo;s interpretation that rosy apples were used, remembering,
however, that the fruit of the rose tree, the hip, dog-briar, eglantine is
also made into dainty confections on the Continent today. It is therefore entirely
possible that this recipe calls for the fruit of the rose tree.</p>

<p class="note">[1] Lister praises the early green fruit and the use thereof, and, as a physician,
recommends imitation of the above as follows: <i>In aliis plurimis locis hujus
fructus mentio fit; ususque mirabilis fuit; &amp; certe propter salubritatem, nostram
imitationem meretur.</i></p>

<p class="note">[2] We do not like the &ldquo;pepper&rdquo; in this connection and we venture to suggest
that in this case the term probably stands for some other kind of aromatic
seed less pungent than the grain known to us as &ldquo;pepper&rdquo; and one more acceptable
to the fine flavor of fruit, namely pimiento, allspice for instance, or clove, or
nutmeg, or a mixture of these. &ldquo;Pepper&rdquo; formerly was a generic term for all of
these spices but was gradually confined to the grain pepper of black and white
varieties.</p>

<p class="note">[3] We concur with Lister&rsquo;s idea of the use of early fruits. The use of early
and unripe fruit for this and similar purposes is excellent. The above formula is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
good example of our own &ldquo;spiced&rdquo; peaches, pears, etc., usually taken as a
relish. Of course, we use sugar instead of honey for sweetening, and brandy instead
of wine; but the underlying principles are alike.</p>

<p class="note">This is a good illustration of and speaks well for the economy and the ingenuity
of the ancients.</p>

<p class="note">[2] <i>Puls</i>&mdash;formerly a simple porridge of various kinds of cereals or legumes,
eaten by the Romans before bread came into use. <i>Puls</i> remained in use after the
introduction of bread only as a food of the poor. It was also used at sacrifices.
The <i>pultes</i> and <i>pulticul&aelig;</i> given by Apicius are illustrations of the ever-present
desire to improve&mdash;to glorify, as it were, a thing which once was or still is of
vital importance in the daily life of humans. The <i>nouveaux-riches</i> of the ancient
and the modern world cannot find it easy to separate themselves from their
traditions nor are they wont to put up with their plainness, hence the fancy
trimmings. The development of the American pie is a curious analogy in this
respect. We see in this the intricate working of human culture, its eternal strife
for perfection. And perfection is synonymous with decay. The fare of the Carthusian
monks, professed, stern vegetarians, underwent the same tortuous evolution.</p>

<p class="note">[3] Named for Didius Julianus, the emperor who was a vegetarian. Of
course, his majesty could not live on a plain porridge, hence the Apician artistry.
The <i>pultes</i> were popular with the many professed vegetarians though the obliging
cooks mixed finely ground meat in this and other porridges.</p>

<p class="note">Our various cream soups and legume pur&eacute;es&mdash;those most salubrious creations
of modern cookery are no doubt lineal descendants from the Apician <i>pultes</i>.

overrated. As a gastronomer he may be safely relegated to the vast multitude of
ill-advised people whose craving for carbohydrates (which is perhaps pathological)
causes them to accumulate a surplus of fat. This was fatal to Vitellius and
his faithful court baker who is said to have stuck to his master to the last. The
poor emperor&rsquo;s <i>embonpoint</i> proved cumbersome when he fled the infuriated
mob. Had he been leaner he might have effected a &ldquo;getaway.&rdquo; He was dragged

[3] These apparently outlandish ways of cooking beans compel us to draw
a modern parallel in a cookery book, specializing in Jewish dishes. To prove
that Apicius is not dead &ldquo;by a long shot,&rdquo; we shall quote from Wolf, Rebekka:
Kochbuch f&uuml;r Israelitische Frauen, Frankfurt, 1896, 11th edition. As a matter
of fact, Rebekka Wolf is outdoing Apicius in strangeness&mdash;a case of <i>Apicium
in ipso Apicio</i>, as Lister sarcastically remarks of Torinus.</p>

<p class="note">Rebekka Wolf: &#8478; No. 211&mdash;wash and boil the young beans in fat <i>bouillon</i>
(Apicius: <i>oleum et liquamen</i>) adding a handful of chopped pepperwort (A.:
<i>piper, ligusticum</i>) and later chopped parsley (A.: <i>petroselinum</i>) some sugar
(A.: <i>mel pavo</i>&mdash;little honey) and pepper. Beans later in the season are cooked
with potatoes. The young beans are tied with flour dissolved in water, or with
roux.</p>

<p class="note"><i>Id. ibid.</i>, &#8478; No. 212, Beans Sweet-Sour. Boil in water, fat, salt, add vinegar,
sugar or syrup, &ldquo;English aromatics&rdquo; and spices, lemon peel, and a little pepper;
bind with roux.</p>

<p class="note"><i>Id. ibid.</i>, &#8478; No. 213, Cut Pickled Beans (<i>Schneidebohnen</i>) prepare as &#8478; No.
212, but if you would have them more delicious, take instead of the roux grated
chocolate, sugar, cinnamon, lemon peel and lemon juice, and some claret. If not
sour enough, add vinegar, but right here you must add more fat; you may lay
on top of this dish a bouquet of sliced apples.</p>

<p class="note"><i>Id. ibid.</i>, &#8478; No. 214, Beans and Pears. Take cut and pickled beans and prepare
as above. To this add peeled fresh pears, cut into quarters; then sugar,
lemon peel cut thin, cinnamon, &ldquo;English&rdquo; mixed spices, and at last the roux,
thinned with broth. This dish must be sweet and very fat.</p>

<p class="note">As for exotic combinations, Apicius surely survives here, is even surpassed
by this Jewish cookery book where, no doubt, very ancient traditions have been
stored away.</p>

opinion that the head and its feathers were to be saved for decorative purposes,
in style during the middle ages when game bird patties were decorated with the
fowl&rsquo;s plumage, a custom which survived to Danneil&rsquo;s time (ca. 1900). But this
is not likely to be the case here, for it would be a simple matter to skin the bird

perhaps, excessive seasoning, at least, as compared to our modern methods.</p>

<p>THE ABOVE SAUCE IS ALSO USED FOR THIS DISH. STUFF
THE CHICKEN WITH [peeled] DASHEENS AND [stoned] GREEN
OLIVES, THOUGH NOT TOO MUCH SO THAT THE DRESSING
MAY HAVE ROOM FOR EXPANSION, TO PREVENT BURSTING
WHILE THE CHICKEN IS BEING COOKED IN THE POT. HOLD
IT DOWN WITH A SMALL BASKET, LIFT IT UP FREQUENTLY

<p class="note">[1] Dasheens are the equivalent of the ancient colocasium; at least they are
very close relatives. Cf. Notes to &#8478; Nos. <a href="#r74">74</a>, <a href="#r216">216</a>, <a href="#r244">244</a>, <a href="#r322">322</a>.</p>

<p class="note">[3] Dann. and Goll., not knowing the colocasium or dasheen have entirely
erroneous versions of this formula. The dasheen is well adapted for the stuffing
of fowl. Ordinarily the dasheen is boiled or steamed, mashed, seasoned and then
stuffed inside of a raw chicken which is then roasted. Being very starchy, the
dasheen readily absorbs the fats and juices of the roast, making a delicious dressing,
akin in taste to a combined potato and chestnut pur&eacute;e.</p>

<p class="note">As the above chicken is cooked in <i>bouillon</i> or water, the dasheen may be used
in a raw state for filling. We have tried this method. Instead of confining the
chicken in a basket, we have tied it in a napkin and boiled slowly until done.
Serve cold, with the above dressing.</p>

<p class="note">[3] The use of water to clarify the oil which is to serve as a deep frying fat
is an ingenious idea, little practised today. It surely saves the fat or oil, prevents
premature burning or blackening by frequent use, and gives a better tasting
<i>friture</i>. The above recipe is a mere fragment, but even this reveals the extraordinary
knowledge of culinary principles of Apicius who reveals himself to us
as a master of well-understood principles of good cookery that are so often
ignored today. Cf. Note 5 to &#8478; No. <a href="#r497">497</a>.</p>

<p class="note">[4] The recipe fails to state that the chicken must be breaded, or that the
pieces of chicken be turned in flour, etc., and fried in the oil.</p>

<p class="note">[5] Another vital rule of deep fat frying not stated, or rather stated in the
language of the kitchen, namely that the chicken must be crisp, dry, that is,
not saturated with oil, which of course every good fry cook knows.</p>

<p class="note">[6] With the cream sauce, prepared separately, spread on the platter, with
the fried chicken inside, or the sauce in a separate dish, we have here a very close
resemblance to a very popular modern dish.</p>

hungry pigs were crammed with dry figs and then suddenly given all the mead
they wanted to drink. The violent expansion of the figs in the stomachs, or the
fermentation caused acute indigestion which killed the pigs. The livers were very
much enlarged, similar to the cramming of geese for the sake of obtaining abnormally
large livers. This latter method prevailed in the Strassburg District
until recently when it was prohibited by law.</p>

that these shoots make very desirable vegetables when properly cooked, we feel
inclined to include these among the term &ldquo;bulbs.&rdquo; Platina also adds the squill or

<p class="note">[2] Tor. who is trying hard to explain the <i>colocasium</i>. His name, &ldquo;Egyptian
Bean&rdquo; may be due to the mealiness and bean-like texture of the <i>colocasium</i>
tuber; otherwise there is no resemblance to a bean, except, perhaps, the seed pod
which is not used for food. This simile has led other commentators to believe
that the <i>colocasium</i> in reality was a bean.</p>

<p class="note">The U.S. Department of Agriculture has in recent years imported various
specimens of that taro species (belonging to the <i>colocasia</i>), and the plants are now
successfully being farmed in the southern parts of the United States, with fair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
prospects of becoming an important article of daily diet. The Department has
favored us repeatedly with samples of the taro, or dasheen, (<i>Colocasium Antiquorum</i>)
and we have made many different experiments with this agreeable,
delightful and important &ldquo;new&rdquo; vegetable. It can be prepared in every way like
a potato, and possesses advantages over the potato as far as value of nutrition,
flavor, culture and keeping qualities are concerned. As a commercial article, it
is not any more expensive than any good kind of potato. It grows where the
potato will not thrive, and vice versa. It thus saves much in freight to parts
where the potato does not grow.</p>

<p class="note">The ancient <i>colocasium</i> is no doubt a close relative of the modern dasheen or
taro. The Apician <i>colocasium</i> was perhaps very similar to the ordinary Elephant-Ear,
<i>colocasium Antiquorum Schott</i>, often called <i>caladium esculentum</i>, or <i>tanyah</i>,
more recently called the &ldquo;Dasheen&rdquo; which is a corruption of the French &ldquo;de
Chine&rdquo;&mdash;from China&mdash;indicating the supposed origin of this variety of taro.
The dasheen is a broad-leaved member of the <i>arum</i> family. The name dasheen
originated in the West Indies whence it was imported into the United States
around 1910, and the name is now officially adopted.</p>

<p class="note">Mark Catesby, in his Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama
Islands, London, 1781, describes briefly under the name of <i>arum maximum
Aegypticum</i> a plant which was doubtless one of the tanyahs or taros. He says:
&ldquo;This was a welcome improvement among the negroes and was esteemed a blessing;
they being delighted with all their African food, particularly this, which
a great part of Africa subsists much on.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">Torinus, groping for the right name, calls it variously <i>colosium</i>, <i>coledium</i>,
<i>coloesium</i>, till he finally gets it right, <i>colocasium</i>.</p>

<p class="note">[3] The root or tubers of this plant was used by the ancients as a vegetable.
They probably boiled and then peeled and sliced the tubers, seasoning the pieces
with the above ingredients, heated them in bouillon stock and thickened the
gravy in the usual way. Since the tuber is very starchy, little roux is required for
binding.</p>

of a head of lettuce, three snails, two eggs, a barley cake, sweet wine, refrigerated

it also means &ldquo;pregnant.&rdquo; For this double sense the formula may be interpreted

with unborn baby lamb, which in antiquity as today is often killed principally
for its skin.</p>

the last part of the formula, enumerating a number of fresh vegetables.
It is unthinkable for any gourmet to incorporate these with the rich dressing.
The vegetables should be used as a garnish for the finished roast. This leads us to
believe that the above is really two distinct formul&aelig;, or that the vegetables

<p class="note">[1] Tor. sentence wanting in other texts.</p>

<p class="note">[2] Note the position of lovage in this formula. Usually it follows pepper.
We have finally accounted for this peculiarity. Torinus, throughout the original,
treats &ldquo;pepper&rdquo; and &ldquo;lovage&rdquo; as one spice, whereas we have kept the two separate.
He believed it to be a certain kind of pepper&mdash;<i>piper Ligusticum</i>. <i>Piper</i>, as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
matter of fact, stands for pepper, and <i>Ligusticum</i> is the herb, Lovage, an umbelliferous
plant, also called <i>Levisticum</i>. The fact that the two words are here
separated plainly shows that Torinus has been in the dark about this matter
almost to the end.</p>

<p class="note">One wonders why he did not change or correct this error in the preceding
books. His marginal errata prove that his work was being printed as he wrote it,
or furnished copy therefor&mdash;namely in installments. Since the printer&rsquo;s type
was limited, each sheet was printed in the complete edition, and the type was
then used over again for the next sheet.</p>

<h2 class="padtop"><a name="excerpts" id="excerpts"></a>THE EXCERPTS FROM APICIUS<br />
BY VINIDARIUS<br />
THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAN</h2>

<p class="center lrgfont"><i>Apici Excerpta A Vinidario Viro Inlustri</i></p>

<p class="center">FIFTH CENTURY</p>


<p>Vinidarius, a Goth, of noble birth or a scientist, living in Italy. Vinithaharjis
is the native name. Of his time and life very little is known. It appears that
he was a student of Apicius and that he made certain excerpts from that book
which are preserved in the uncial codex of Salmasius, s&aelig;c. VIII, Paris, lat. 10318.</p>

<p>Vollmer in his Apicius commentary says that Salmasius and his predecessors
have accepted them as genuine. Schuch incorporated these recipes in the Apicius
text of his editions, in appropriate places, as he thought. This course cannot be
recommended, although the recipes should form an integral part of any Apicius
edition.</p>

<p>M. Ihm, who faithfully reprinted the excerpta in the Archiv f. lat. Lex. XV,
64, ff. says distinctly: &ldquo;These excerpts have nothing to do with the ten books
of Apicius, even if some recipes resemble each other ...&rdquo; and other researchers
have expressed the same opinion. Vollmer, however, does not share this view.</p>

<p>If I may be permitted to concur with Vollmer, I would say that the excerpts
are quite Apician in character, and that in a sense they fill certain gaps in the
Apicius text, although the language is strongly vulgarized which may be readily
expected to be the case in the age of Vinidarius.</p>

<p>The recipes of Anthimus, written around A.D. 511 also confirm the close relation
existing between Vinidarius and Apicius. Anthimus was the Greek physician
to Theodoric I, (The Great), Frankish king living in Italy. He was not acquainted
with Apicius.</p>

<p class="note">[1] It is interesting to note how the generic terms, <i>salacaccabia</i> and <i>caccabina</i>
have degenerated here. In these formulas the terms have lost all resemblance to
the former meaning, the original &ldquo;salt meat boiled in a pot.&rdquo; Such changes
are very often observed in the terminology of our modern kitchens, in every language.
They make the definition of terms and the classification of subjects extremely
difficult. They add much to the confusion among cooks and guests in
public dining places and create misunderstandings that only an expert can explain.</p>

<p class="note">[2] This dish affords an opportunity for a decorative scheme by the arrangement
of the various vegetables and meats in a pleasing and artistic manner,
utilizing the various colors and shapes of the bits of food as one would use pieces
of stone in a mosaic. Of course, such a design can be appreciated only if the
chartreuse is served unmoulded, i.e. if the cook succeeds in unmoulding it without
damaging the structure.</p>

AND THUS BRAISE [3].</p>

<p class="note">[1] Derived from <i>garum</i> or <i>&oelig;nogarum</i>, the wine sauce. These are supposed
to be meat balls or cutlets prepared with garum, but the <i>garum</i> is not mentioned
in the formula. This also illustrates the interesting etymology of the word. It is
not recognized in every-day ancient language because it is a typical technical
term, the much complained-of <i>lingua culinaria</i>. We find, therefore, that&mdash;at
least in this instance&mdash;<i>garum</i> no longer stands for a sauce made from the fish,
<i>garus</i>, but that <i>garum</i> has become a generic term for certain kinds of sauces.
Danneil renders <i>garatus</i> with <i>lasaratus</i>, which is clearly out of place.</p>

<p class="note">[2] In this instance, and in several others, and also according to Sueton. C&aelig;s.
fluids were weighed. What idea could be more practical, useful and more &ldquo;modern&rdquo;
than this? Sheer commercial greed, stubbornness, indolence have thus far
made futile all efforts towards more progressive methods in handling food stuffs,
particularly in the weighing of them and in selling them by their weight. Present
market methods are very chaotic, and are kept purposely so to the detriment of
the buyer.</p>

<p class="note">[3] The original: <i>et sic frigis</i>.&mdash;<i>Frigo</i> is equivalent to frying, drying, parching;
the word here has taken on a broader meaning, because the &ldquo;frying&rdquo; process
is clearly out of question here. It appears that the terminology of <i>frigo</i> and that
of <i>asso</i> in the next formula, has not been clearly defined. As a matter of fact, not
many modern cooks today are able to give a clear definition of such terms as
frying, broiling, roasting, braising, baking, which are thus subject to various
interpretations.</p>

[4] Thrush and other game birds of such small size are not emptied in the
usual way: they are cooked with the entrails, or, the intestines are taken out,
seasoned, saut&eacute;, and are either put back into the carcasses, or are served separately
on bread croutons. In this instance, the necessary seasoning is introduced
through the throat, a most ingenious idea that can only occur to Apicius.</p>

<p class="note">[5] In other instances we have pointed out where a small amount of water
was used to clarify the oil used for frying foods. The presence here of water
leads us to believe that the thrush were not &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;boiled&rdquo; but that they
were fried in a generous amount of oil; this would make the ancient process remarkably
similar to the present European way of preparing thrush or fieldfare,
or similar game birds.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF MANUSCRIPTS</h3>


<h4><a name="apiciana_i" id="apiciana_i"></a>I, 9TH CENTURY</h4>

<p>New York, Library of the Academy of Medicine, until 1930 in Cheltenham,
Gloucester, Biblioth. Phillipps, 275, in the library of Sir Thomas Phillipps, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
codex ca. Ninth century, 4to, parchment, 275 pp., originally bound up with
Phill. 386, which is said to have come from the Benedictine Abbey of St. Ghislain,
founded at the end of the 7th century in the diocese of Cambrai; partly in
Continental, but mostly in Anglo-Saxon minuscle of the 9th century, not unlike
the Anglo-Saxon minuscle of Fulda.</p>

<p>Title missing. Cf. Vollmer, Studien, pp. 5-6.</p>

<p>The writer who has hastily inspected the manuscript in 1931 is of the opinion
that three different hands wrote this book. Part of the index is gone, too. The
book commences with lib. VII of the index. Bound in an 18th century French
full leather binding. It was brought to America by Dr. Margaret B. Wilson and
presented to the library of the A. of M. in 1931.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_ii" id="apiciana_ii"></a>II, 9TH CENTURY</h4>

<p>Rome, Vatican Library. Vat. Vrbinas, lat. 1146, Ninth century. 58 sheets, 2
blanks in the beginning and 2 at the end. Size 23.75 &times; 18.75 cm., heavy parchment,
20-21 lines to the page, not numbered. Sheet 1 R, illuminated by square
panel in purple and gold letters (capit. quadr.) IN<span class="btop">CP</span> || API || C&AElig; ||&mdash;Nothing
else. Sheet 1 V&mdash;3 R the title, EPIM e || LES LI || BER I, and the titles of
Book I, illuminated with columns, flowers and birds. Sheet 3 R between the foot
of the columns EXPLICIVNT CAPITVLA. Sheet 3 V a panel in purple similar
to sheet 1 R with inscription, IN<span class="btop">CP</span> || CONDIT<span class="btop">V</span> || PARADOX<span class="btop">V</span>. Sheet 4 R
commences the text with the title, I, Conditum Paradoxum. Captions, marginal
figures and initials in red. The captions are written in good uncials throughout,
the first text words usually in half uncials, continuing in an even and beautiful
minuscle. The Explicits and Incipits invariably in capitalis rustica. Sheet 58 V
end of text with EXPLICIT LIBER X.</p>

<p>Traube, Vollmer and others believe that this manuscript was written in or
in the vicinity of Tours in the 9th century.</p>

Britann. I. p. 79 n. 384 and F. Madan, A Summary Catalogue of Western Mss.
in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, 1905, p. 660. Vollmer says that this Ms. belonged
to a son of Humelbergius, as proven by P. Lehmann.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_xii" id="apiciana_xii"></a>XII, 14TH CENTURY</h4>

<p>Cesena, bibl. municip., 14th century.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_xiii" id="apiciana_xiii"></a>XIII</h4>

<p>A manuscript in the library of the Sforza brothers at Pesaro which burned in
1514, known only from the catalogue. Cf. A. Vernarecci, La Libreria di Gio.
Sforza in Archivio storico per le Marche e l&rsquo;Umbria, III, 1886, 518, 790.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_xiv" id="apiciana_xiv"></a>XIV</h4>

<p>A manuscript used by Bonifaz Amerbach and Joh. Sichardus. Cf. P. Lehman,
Joh. Sichardus, Quellen und Untersuchungen, IV, 1, p. 204.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_xv" id="apiciana_xv"></a><a name="apiciana_xvi" id="apiciana_xvi"></a>XV-XVI</h4>

<p>The two manuscripts mentioned by Albanus Torinus, in his edition of Apicius,
Basel, 1541. In 1529 Torinus found an Apicius &ldquo;codex&rdquo; on the island of Megalona
(Maguellone) which he used for his edition of Apicius. It is almost certain
that this was not a very ancient manuscript. The way Torinus speaks of it and
of the (first) Venetian printed edition in his <i>epistola dedicatoria</i> leaves even
doubt as to whether his authority was handwritten or printed. A first edition,
printed ca. 1483, may have well been a dilapidated copy such as Torinus describes
in 1529. Torinus admits taking some liberties with the text and failed to
understand some phrases of it. Despite this fact, his text, from a culinary point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of view seems to be more authentic than the Humelbergius and Lister versions.</p>

<p>The other codex according to Torinus, was found in Transsylvania by Io.
Honterus of Coronea. This codex may have served as authority for the first
edition printed ca. 1483 by Bernardinus, of Venice. No other mention is made
of this codex anywhere, which according to Torinus, was sent to Venice from
Transsylvania. The text of the Editio Princeps, by the way, is thoroughly unreliable.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_xvii" id="apiciana_xvii"></a>XVII, 15TH CENTURY</h4>

<p>Ms. Rome, Vatican Library, lat. 6803, 15th Century.</p>


<h4><a name="apiciana_xviii" id="apiciana_xviii"></a>XVIII, 15TH CENTURY</h4>

<p>Munich, lat. 756. Ex bibl. Petri Victorii 49. 15th century. This codex is particularly
valuable and important for the identification of the Apicius text. Cf.
Vollmer, Studien, pp. 10 <i>seq.</i></p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF PRINTED EDITIONS</h3>

<p>These summaries and descriptions of the known manuscript books and printed
editions of Apicius are presented with a desire to afford the students a survey of
the field treated in this volume, to illustrate the interest that has existed throughout
the past centuries in our ancient book.</p>

<p>Copies of any Apicius edition and commentaries are scarce; famous collectors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
pride themselves in owning one or several of them. Of the well-known collections
of cookery books the most outstanding perhaps is that of Theodor Drexel,
of Frankfurt on the Main, who owned nine different editions of Apicius. The
Drexel catalogue forms the basis of a bibliography&mdash;Verzeichnis der Litteratur
&uuml;ber Speise und Trank bis zum Jahre 1887, bearbeitet von Carl Georg, Hannover,
1888, describing some 1700 works.</p>

<p>The Drexel collection, combined with that of Dr. Freund, is now in the Staatsbibliothek
in Berlin and is undoubtedly the finest collection of its kind.</p>

<p>Another famous collection of cookery books is described in My Cookery
Books, by Elizabeth Robins Pennell, Boston, 1903, listing three of the Apicii.</p>

<p>The Pennell collection was destroyed by a flood in London while being stored
away in a warehouse during the world war.</p>

<p>The most important bibliography, well-known to bibliophiles, is the Bibliographie
gastronomique par Georges Vicaire, Paris, 1890. Vicaire mentions eleven
Apicius editions.</p>

<p>The Baron Pichon and the Georges Vicaire collections are both dispersed.</p>

<p>Despite ardent efforts over a period of many years the writer has been unable
to secure either an Apicius manuscript or the editions No. <a href="#apiciana_1">1</a> and <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a>. The existence
of No. <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a> on our list is doubtful. Therefore, we do not pretend having inspected
or read each and every edition described herein, but by combining the efforts of
the authorities here cited we have gathered the following titles and descriptions
in order to present a complete survey of the Apician literature.</p>

<p>Large 8vo. Edition disputed by bibliographers.</p>

<p>Ex Bernhold, <i>pr&aelig;fatio</i>, p. IX, who (we are translating from his Latin text)
says, &ldquo;Here is the exterior of the book as extant in the Nuremberg library, most
accurately and neatly described by the very famous and most worthy physician
of that illustrious republic, Dr. Preus, a friend of mine for thirty years; whose
integrity, of course, is above reproach; these are his own words&mdash;The book is
made in the size called large octavo. It must be mentioned that the sheets are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
indeed large, so that the size might be styled an ordinary quarto. Fabricius, in his
Bibliotheca, the newest edition, quotes a copy under this name. The entire book
consists of five parts [sheets, folded into eight leaves&mdash;sixteen printed pages&mdash;stitched
together] and two leaves. These five parts contain the text proper;
these two sheets preceding them, are occupied by the title page, the dedication
and a kind of poetic address. The text itself commences with p. 5, I should say,
though there is no regular pagination. However, there are nevertheless in the
lower ends of the leaves, called the limp parts, some conspicuous letters on the
first four leaves of the sheets, while the remaining four leaves though belonging
to the respective parts, are blank. For instance aI., aII., aIII., aIIII. Then follows
the next sheet or part, signed, bI., II., III., IIII. in the same manner, with the
four following leaves blank. And thus in the same manner follows sheet c, d, e.
The two leaves preceding the five parts which comprise the text proper, contain
the title of the book, Apicius Culinaris [<i>sic</i>] nowhere, to be sure, appears a
note of the place or the date where and when the book was made, and on this
whole first page, aside from the words already noted, there is nothing else in
evidence than the picture of an angel, in the center of which there is the sign,
IHS, and around the circle the following words are read, &lsquo;Joannes de Lagniano
M.&rsquo; At the feet of the angel spaces may be seen that are inscribed with the letters,
I.O.L. The next page, or the verso of the title page, exhibits the dedication
of Blasius Lancilotus, extending to the upper part of the third page. On this very
same page occurs the poem by Ludovicus Vopiscus, addressed to Joannes Antonius
Riscius, comprising five very beautiful distichs. The remaining part of
the third page is finished off with the word, &lsquo;Finis,&rsquo; while the fourth page is
entirely blank. The text of Apicius commences with the fifth, as mentioned
above, and from now on the leaves are numbered by letters, as previously described.
At the end of the text, on the last page of the book, a poem is conspicuous,
entitled, &lsquo;Antonius Mota to the Public,&rsquo; consisting of four neat
distichs, followed by another composition, containing five distichs by Joannes
Salandus. And conclusion of the entire work is made with these words, &lsquo;Printed
at Milan by Master Guiliermus de Signerre Rothomagensis, in the year of the
Lord 1490, on the 8th day of the month of January.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From this edition, the oldest as well as the rarest&mdash;with no other known
earlier edition&mdash;all the variants given herewith have been collected by Goezius.&rdquo;
Thus far Bernhold.</p>

<p>The existence of this edition is doubted by Brunet, according to Vicaire. This
ancient description corresponds substantially to that of Vicaire of the following
edition of 1498 which Vicaire proclaims to be the first dated Apicius edition.
It is interesting to note, however, what Bernhold has to say of this 1498 edition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt a repetition of the preceding edition,&rdquo; says he; and he goes
on quoting the Bibliotheca Latina Fabricio-Ernestina (Jo. Alberti Fabricii Bibliothec.
Latin. edit ab Ernesti 1708) to the effect that two editions were printed
at Milan, one of 1490 by Blasius Lancilotus and one of 1498 by Guiliermus de
Signerre Rothomagensis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Our inquiry at the Municipal library of N&uuml;rnberg has revealed the fact that
this copy of 1490 is no longer in the possession of the library there.</p>

<p class="topcapt">COLOPHON, MILAN EDITION, 1498</p>

<p class="midcapt">From the Lancilotus edition of Apicius, printed by Signerre, Milan, 1498, the first dated edition. The
poems by Mota and Salandus are identical with the colophon of the 1503 Venice edition.</p>

<p class="subcapt">Note the date of this colophon and observe how easily it can be read for &ldquo;the 8th day of January,
1490&rdquo; which date is attributed to our Apiciana No. <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a>. This edition, as is noted, is doubtful, although
several bibliographers speak about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
This copy has on the fly leaf the book plate of &ldquo;Georgius Klotz, M.D. Francofurti
ad M&oelig;num&rdquo; and the autograph of John S. Blackie, 1862.</p>

<p>Bernhold, p. XI. Not in Georg-Drexel. Vicaire, 28; he reads Appicius [<i>sic</i>]
Culinarius. Pennell and Vicaire read Guilerum, Bernhold Guilierum.</p>

<p>Vicaire&rsquo;s description of this edition tallies with that of Bernhold&rsquo;s and his
collaborator&rsquo;s account of the preceding edition. There are certain copies of this
edition, bearing the following titles, Apicius de re coquinaria and Apicivs in re
qvoqvinaria. Cf. Vicaire, 28-29.</p>


<h4>NOTES TO NOS. 1, 2, AND 3</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke</span>, Leipzig, 1926, II, p. 510, places as
the first printed edition Apicius in re quoquinaria [<i>sic</i>] printed by William de
Signerre at Milan, on the 20th day of January, 1498. The second place is given
<span class="smcap">Apicius de re coquinaria</span> printed by Bernardinus de Vitalibus at Venice, no
date, circa 1500 (our No. <a href="#apiciana_1">1</a>). This classification follows that of Brunet in 1840.
Neither the Gesamtkatalog nor Brunet make any mention whatsoever of the
doubtful 1490 Milan edition (our No. <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a>).</p>

<p>Vicaire, col. 33, mentioning this edition citing Bernhold, quotes Brunet as
doubting the existence of this 1490 edition, but we fail to notice this expression
of doubt since our Brunet is altogether silent on the subject, same as the other
bibliographers.</p>

<p>Vicaire, col. 28-29, quotes Brunet as saying that the undated Apicius (our
No. <a href="#apiciana_1">1</a>) despite its sub-titles of Suetonius, contains only the Apicius text, a
statement confirmed by Pennell.</p>

<p>A search of all the available works of Joh. Alb. Fabricius&mdash;Bibliotheca
Latina [Classics], Hamburg, 1722, Bibliographia Antiquaria, ib. 1760 and the
Bibliotheca Latina medi&aelig; et infim&aelig; [middle ages], ib. 1735, has failed to reveal
a trace of the 1490 Apicius, displayed by Bernhold, as described by Fabricius
and as seen by Preus in the N&uuml;rnberg Municipal Library.</p>

<p>Our facsimile of the 1498 colophon shows how easily its date can be mistaken
for &ldquo;the 8th day of January, 1490,&rdquo; Bernhold&rsquo;s very date! Evidently an error
of this kind made victims of Preus, Bernhold and Fabricius (if, indeed, he
quoted it) and caused us some ardent searching among dusty tomes. We have
therefore come to the conclusion that either this 1490 edition disappeared between
the year 1787 and our time or else that it never existed.</p>

<p class="topcapt">TITLE PAGE, VENICE EDITION, 1503</p>

<p class="subcapt">From the Blasius Lancilotus edition, printed by Johannes de Cereto de Tridino alias Tacuinus, Venice,
1503. This is the second dated edition of Apicius, resembling very closely the undated edition and also the
Milan edition, printed by Signerre 1498, the first to bear a date. Same size as the original. This is a first
timid attempt at giving a book a title page. Most books printed before this date have no title pages.</p>

<p>On the last page of our copy are the two poems mentioned in the 1490 Milan
edition (No. <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a>) &ldquo;Antonius mota ad uulgus&rdquo; (4 distichs) and &ldquo;Iohannes salandi
Lectori&rdquo; (5 distichs). The verso of this page is blank. The dedication, on the
verso of title page, is likewise by Blasius Lancilotus. It appears that this edition
is closely related to No. <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a>.</p>

<p class="topcapt">TITLE PAGE, LYONS, 1541</p>

<p class="subcapt">This edition, printed in Lyons, France, in 1541, by Sebastian Gryphius is said to have been pirated from
the Torinus edition given at Basel in the same year. Early printers stole copiously from one another, frequently
reproduced books with hundreds of illustrations with startling speed. Gryphius corrected Torinus&rsquo;
spelling of &ldquo;P&rdquo; [Bartholom&aelig;us] Platina, but note the spelling of &ldquo;Lvg[v]dvni&rdquo; (Lyons). Inscription by a
contemporary reader over the griffin: &ldquo;This [book] amuses me! Why make fun of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strange enough, there is another edition of this work, bearing the same editor&rsquo;s
name, printed at Lyons, France, in the same year. This edition, printed by
Gryphius, bears the abbreviated title as follows:</p>

a griffin standing on a box-like pedestal, supported by a winged globe. On
the left of the device: &ldquo;virtute duci,&rdquo; on the right: &ldquo;comite fortuna&rdquo;; directly
underneath: &ldquo;Apvd Seb. Gryphivm, Lvgvdvni [<i>sic</i>], 1541.&rdquo; Sm. 8vo. Pages
numbered, commencing with verso of title from 2-314. Sheets lettered same as
Basel edition; on verso of title &ldquo;Katalogos&rdquo; etc. exactly like Basel. Page 3 commences
with the same epistola dedicatoria. This dedication and the entire corpus
of the book is printed in an awkward Italic type, except the captions which are
in 6 pt. and 8 pt. Roman. The book is quite an unpleasant contrast with the
fine Antiqua type and the generous margins of the Basel edition. Some woodcut
initials but of small interest. The index, contrary to Basel, is in the back. The
last page shows another printer&rsquo;s device, differing from that on the title, another
griffin.</p>

<p>This edition, though bearing Platina&rsquo;s correct initial, B., has the fictitious title
given to his work by Torinus, who probably possessed one of the earliest editions
of Platina&rsquo;s De honesta Voluptate, printed without a title page.</p>

<p>Altogether, this Lyons edition looks very much like a hurried job, and we
would not be surprised to learn that it was pirated from the Basel edition.</p>

<p>The epistola dedicatoria, in which Torinus expresses fear of pirates and asks
his patron&rsquo;s protection, is concluded with the date, Basile&aelig;, v. Idus Martias, Anno
M. D. XLI., while the copy described by Vicaire appears to be without this date.
Vicaire also says that the sheets of his copy are not numbered. He also reads on
the title &ldquo;Lvgdvni, 1541&rdquo; which is spelled correctly, but not in accordance with
the original. Of these two editions Vicaire says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ces deux &eacute;ditions portent la m&ecirc;me date de 1541, mais celle qui a &eacute;t&eacute; publi&eacute;e
&agrave; B&acirc;le a paru avant celle donn&eacute;e &agrave; Lyon par Seb. Gryphe. Cette derni&egrave;re, en
effet, contient la d&eacute;dicace dat&eacute;e.&rdquo; The title page of our copy is inscribed by three
different old hands, one the characteristic remark: &ldquo;Mulcens me, gannis?&rdquo; This
copy is bound in the original vellum. Vicaire, 31, G.-Drexel, No. 12.</p>

<p>The work of Torinus has been subjected to a searching analysis, as will be
shown throughout the book. An appreciation of Platina will be found in Platina,
m&aelig;stro nell&rsquo;arte culinaria Un&rsquo;interessante studio di Joseph D. Vehling, by Agostino
Cavalcab&ograve;, Cremona, 1935.</p>

<p class="subcapt">The first Apicius edition by Martin Lister, Court Physician to Queen Anne. Printed in London in 1705
by the famous printer, William Bowyer. This is one of the rarest of the Apician books, the edition being
limited to 120 copies. It has been said that the second edition (Amsterdam, 1709) was limited to 100
copies, but there is no evidence to that effect.</p>

<p>Lister&rsquo;s preface to the reader occupies pp. I-XIV; the same appears in the
1709 (2nd) edition. The ten books of Apicius occupy pp. 1-231; the index
comprises 11 unnumbered leaves; on the verso of the 11th leaf, the errata. One
leaf for the &ldquo;Catalogus&rdquo; (not mentioned by Vicaire) a bibliography of the
editor&rsquo;s extensive writings, and works used in this edition principally upon
nature and medical subjects. This list was ridiculed by Dr. King. Cf. <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>

pages are repeated in the next chapter, pp. 113-130, &ldquo;Vari&aelig; Lectiones Manuscripti
Vaticani,&rdquo; headed by the same note, the text of which is herewith given
in full. Bernhold states that these Vari&aelig; Lectiones have been taken from the
second Lister edition (No. <a href="#apiciana_8">8</a>) where they are found following p. 277. The first
Lister edition does not contain these Vari&aelig;, nor does Lister have the Variantes
ex Blasii Lanciloti. The following note to the Vatican variants appears in the
second Lister edition also:</p>

blank leaf.</p>

<p>Described by Vicaire, 33, who has only seen the 1791 edition; G.-Drexel, No.
165; Brunet I. 343. Neither Vicaire nor Georg-Drexel have the date and place
of publication, which in our copy is hidden on p. 81.</p>

<p>Georg reads Apicii C&oelig;lii instead of the above. On the fly leaf the autograph
of G. L. Fournier, Bayreuth, 1791.</p>

<p>Bernhold has based his edition upon Lister and on the edition by Blasius
Lancilotus, Milan, 1490, (our No. <a href="#apiciana_2">2</a>, which see.) Aside from the preface in
which Bernhold names this and other Apicius editions, unknown to the bibliographers,
the editor has not added any of his own observations. Being under
the influence of Lister, he joins the English editor in the condemnation of Torinus.
His work is valuable because of the above mentioned variants.</p>

<p>No date (<i>in fine</i> October 16th, 1933). Three blank leaves, false title; on
verso, facing the title page (!) &ldquo;<i>du m&egrave;me auteur</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a full-page advertisement
of the author&rsquo;s many-sided publications, past and future. Title page, verso blank.
On p. ix <i>Introduction</i>, a lengthy discourse on dining in ancient times, including
a mention of Apician manuscripts and editions. This commences on p. Li with
<i>Les Manuscrits d&rsquo;Apicius</i>. The <i>Introduction</i> finishes on p. Lxxviii. On p. 1 <i>Les
Dix Livres d&rsquo;Apicius</i>, on p. 2 a facsimile in black of the <i>incipit</i> of the Vatican
manuscript, Apiciana <a href="#apiciana_ii">II</a>. On p. 3 commences the translation into French of the
Apician text, finishing on p. 308. <i>Table Analytique</i> (index) pp. 309-322. Follow
three unnumbered sheets, on the first page of which is the <i>Justification du
tirage</i>, with the date of printing and the printer&rsquo;s name, Durand of Chartres.
The copies printed are numbered from 1 to 679. The copy before us is No. 2;
copies 1 to 4 are printed on Montval vellum, 5 to 29 on Dutch Pannekoek vellum,
the rest, 30 to 679 on Vidalon vellum paper.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the present work did not reach us until after ours had gone to
press. The text of this edition, the first to appear in the French language, could
not be considered in our work, for this reason.</p>

<p>However, a few casual remarks about it may be in order here.</p>

<p>A hasty perusal reveals the disconcerting fact that the editor has been influenced
by and has followed the example of Schuch by the adoption of his
system of numbering the recipes. We do not approve of his inclusion of the
excerpts of Vinidarius in the Apician text.</p>

<p>The observations presented in this edition are rich and varied. The material,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
comprising the <i>Introduction</i> and also the explanatory notes to the recipes are
interesting, copious and well-authenticated. The editor reveals himself to be a
better scholar, well-read in the classics, than a practical cook, well-versed in
kitchen practice. Frequently, for instance, he confounds <i>liquamen</i> with <i>garum</i>,
the age-old shortcoming of the Apician scholars.</p>

<p>The advertisement facing the title page of this work is misplaced, disturbing.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we welcome this French version which merits a thorough study;
this we hope to publish at some future date. Any serious and new information on
Apicius is welcome and much needed to clear up the mysteries. The advent of
a few additional cooks on the scene doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let them give lie to the old
proverb that too many cooks spoil the broth. Apicius has been so thoroughly
scrambled during the sixteen-hundred years preceding his first printing which
started the scholars after him. So far, with the exception of a few minor instances,
they have done remarkably well. The complete unscrambling can be
done only by many new cooks, willing to devote much pain and unremunerative,
careful, patient work in discovering new evidence and adding it to what
there is already, to arrive at the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Brandt, the philologist of Munich, is the latest of the Apician
commentators. His researches are quite exhaustive. While not conclusive (as
some of the problems will perhaps never be solved) he has shed much new light
on the vexatious questions of the origin and the authors of our old Roman cookery
book.</p>

<p><a name="cena" id="cena"></a>CENA, COENA, a meal, a repast; CENULA, a
light luncheon; &mdash;&mdash; RECTA, a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; meal, a
formal dinner, usually consisting of GUSTUS,
appetizers and light ENTR&Eacute;ES, the CENA proper
which is the PI&Egrave;CE DE RESISTANCE and
the MENS&AElig; SECUNDAE, or desserts. The main
dish was the CAPUT CENAE; the desserts were
also called BELLARIA or MENSAE POMORUM,
because they usually finished with fruit. Hence
Horace&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;AB OVO USQUE AD MALA&rdquo;
which freely translated and modernized means,
&ldquo;Everything from soup to nuts.&rdquo;</p>

names for state dinners, official banquets, refined

a hectic meal, &mdash;&mdash;TERRESTRIS a vegetarian

a &mdash;&mdash; SATURNIA is one without imported dishes
or delicacies, a national dinner</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>&mdash;&mdash; NOVENDIALIS is the feast given on the ninth
day after the burial of a dead man when his
ashes were scattered while yet warm and fresh.
&mdash;&mdash; DUBIA, &#8478; <a href="#r139">139</a>, is the &ldquo;doubtful meal&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
which causes the conscientious physician Lister
so much worry</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The CENA, to be sure, was an evening meal,
the PRANDIUM, a noon-day meal, a luncheon,
any kind of meal; the JENTACULUM, a
breakfast, an early luncheon; the MERENDA
was a snack in the afternoon between the meals
for those who had &ldquo;earned&rdquo; a bite</p>

&mdash;&mdash; PELLOCIBILIS, &mdash;&mdash; UNCTA, &mdash;&mdash;
EPULARIS, &mdash;&mdash; REGALIS, all more or less
generous affairs, and our list of classical and

was devoted to its character and arrangements</p>

<p><a name="cibarium" id="cibarium"></a>CIBARIUM ALBUM, white repast, white dish,
blancmange. Fr. BLANC MANGER, &ldquo;white eating.&rdquo;
A very old dish. Platina gives a fine recipe
for it; in Apicius it is not yet developed. The
body of this dish is ground almonds and milk,
thickened with meat jelly. Modern cornstarch
puddings have no longer a resemblance to it; to
speak of &ldquo;chocolate&rdquo; blancmange as we do, is a
barbarism. Platina is proud of his C.A. He prefers
it to any Apician dessert. We agree with him;
the incomplete Apicius in Platina&rsquo;s and in our
days has no desserts worth mentioning. A German
recipe of the 13th century (in &ldquo;Ein Buch von
guter Spise&rdquo;) calls C.A. &ldquo;Blamansier,&rdquo; plainly a
corruption of the French. By the translation of
C.A. into the French, the origin of the dish was

later. The ancients called a number of other trees
CITRUS also, including the cedar, the very name

<p><a name="conditura" id="conditura"></a>CONDITURA, a pickle, a preserve, sauce, seasoning,
marinade; the three terms, C., CONDITUM
and CONDIMENTUM are much the same in
meaning, and are used indiscriminately. They
also designate sweet dishes and desserts of different
kinds, including many articles known to us
as confections. Hence the German, KONDITOR,
for confectioner, pastry cook. Nevertheless, a
general outline of the specific meanings of these
terms may be gathered from observing the nature
of the several preparations listed under these
headings, particularly as follows: &mdash;&mdash; ROSATUM,
&#8478; <a href="#r4">4</a>; (cf. No. <a href="#r5">5</a>) &mdash;&mdash;

<p><a name="congrio" id="congrio"></a>CONGER, CONGRIO, CONGRUS, sea-eel, conger.
CONGRUM QUEM ANTIATES BRUNCHUM
APPELLANT,&mdash;Platina, cf. <a href="#anguilla">ANGUILLA</a>.
Plautus uses this fish name to characterize a
very cunning person, a &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; fellow. A cook
is thus called CONGRIO in one of his plays</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<a name="cunila" id="cunila"></a>CONILA, CUNILA, a species of the plant ORIGANUM,
origany, wild marjoram. See <a href="#satureia">SATUREIA</a></p>

<p>CONYZA, the viscous elecampane</p>

<p><a name="cook" id="cook"></a>Cook, COCUS, COQUUS is the most frequent form
used, COCTOR, infrequent. COQUA, COCULA,
female cook; though female cooks were few. The
word is derived from COQUERE, to cook, which
seems to be an imitation of the sound, produced
by a bubbling mess</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The cook&rsquo;s work place (formerly ATRIUM,
the &ldquo;black&rdquo; smoky room) was the CULINA, the
kitchen, hence in the modern Romance tongues
CUISINE, CUCINA, COCINA. Those who work
there are CUISINIERS, COCINEROS, the female
a CUISINI&Egrave;RE, and so forth</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The German and Swedish for &ldquo;kitchen&rdquo; are
K&Uuml;CHE and K&Ouml;KET, but the words &ldquo;cook&rdquo; and
&ldquo;KOCH&rdquo; are directly related to COQUUS</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>A self-respecting Roman cook, especially a
master of the art, having charge of a crew,
would assume the title of MAGIRUS, or ARCHIMAGIRUS,
chief cook. This Greek&mdash;&ldquo;MAGEIROS&rdquo;&mdash;plainly
shows the high regard in which
Greek cookery stood in Rome. No American
CHEF would think of calling himself &ldquo;chief
cook,&rdquo; although CHEF means just that. The
foreign word sounds ever so much better both in
old Rome and in new New York. MAGEIROS
is derived from the Greek equivalent of the verb
&ldquo;to knead,&rdquo; which leads us to the art of baking.
Titles and distinctions were plentiful in the ancient
bakeshops, which plainly indicates departmentisation
and division of labor</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The PISTOR was the baker of loaves, the
DULCIARIUS the cake baker, using honey for
sweetening. Martial says of the PISTOR DULCIARIUS,
&ldquo;that hand will construct for you a
thousand sweet figures of art; for it the frugal
bee principally labors.&rdquo; The PANCHESTRARIUS,
mentioned in Arnobius, is another confectioner.
The LIBARIUS still another of the sweet
craft. The CRUSTULARIUS and BOTULARIUS
were a cookie baker and a sausage maker respectively</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The LACTARIUS is the milkman; the PLACENTARIUS
he who makes the PLACENTA, a
certain pancake, also a kind of cheese cake, often
presented during the Saturnalia. The SCRIBLITARIUS
belongs here, too: in our modern parlance
we would perhaps call these two &ldquo;ENTREMETIERS.&rdquo;
The SCRIBLITA must have been a
sort of hot cake, perhaps an omelet, a pancake,
a dessert of some kind, served hot; maybe just a
griddle cake, baked on a hot stone, a TORTILLA&mdash;what&rsquo;s
the use of guessing! but SCRIBLITAE
were good, for Plautus, in one of his
plays, Poenulus, shouts, &ldquo;Now, then, the SCRIBLITAE
are piping hot! Come hither, fellows!&rdquo;
Not all of them did eat, however, all the time,
for Posidippus derides a cook, saying, CUM SIS
COQUUS, PROFECTUS EXTRA LIMEN ES,
CUM NON PRIUS COENAVERIS, &ldquo;What?
Thou art a cook, and hast gone, without dinner,
over the threshold?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>From the FOCARIUS, the scullion, the FORNACARIUS,
the fireman, or furnace tender, and
the CULINARIUS, the general kitchen helper to
the OBSONATOR, the steward, the FARTOR
to the PRINCEPS COQUORUM, the &ldquo;ma&icirc;tre
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel&rdquo; of the establishment we see an organization
very much similar to our own in any well-conducted
kitchen</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>The Roman cooks, formerly slaves in the frugal
days of the nation, rose to great heights of civic
importance with the spread of civilization and
the advance of luxury in the empire. Cf. &ldquo;The
R&ocirc;le of the Mageiroi in the Life of the Ancient
Greeks&rdquo; by E. M. Rankin, Chic., 1907, and &ldquo;Roman
Cooks&rdquo; by C. G. Harcum, Baltimore, 1914,

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>Mackerel is the oiliest fish, and plentiful, very
well suited for the making of G.</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>G. was also a pickle made of the blood and
the gills of the tunny and of the intestines of
mackerel and other fish. The intestines were exposed
to the sun and fermented. This has stirred
up controversies; the ancients have been denounced
for the &ldquo;vile concoctions,&rdquo; but garum
has been vindicated by modern science as to its
rational preparation and nutritive qualities. Codfish
oil, for instance, has long been known for
its medicinal properties, principally Vitamin D;
this is being increased today by exposure to ultraviolet
rays (just what the ancients did). The
intestines are the most nutritious portions of fish</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>G. still remains a sort of mystery. Its exact
mode of preparation is not known. It was very
popular and expensive, therefore was subject to a
great number of variations in quality and in
price, and to adulteration. For all these reasons
GARUM has been the subject of much speculation.
It appears that the original meaning of G.
became entirely lost in the subsequent variations</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>In 1933 Dr. Margaret B. Wilson sent the author
a bottle of GARUM ROMANUM which she
had compounded according to the formulae at her
disposal. This was a syrupy brown liquid, smelled
like glue and had to be dissolved in water or
wine, a few drops of the G. to a glass of liquid,
of which, in turn, only a few drops were used
to flavor a fish sauce, etc.</p>

used by Gollmer does not fully cover
H.; some indeed, resemble modern croquettes and
kromeskis very closely. The ancients, having no
table forks and only a few knives (which were
for the servants&rsquo; use in carving) were fond of
such preparations as could be partaken of without
table ware. The reclining position at table made
it almost necessary for them to eat H.; such
dishes gave the cooks an opportunity for the display
of their skill, inventive ability, their decorative
and artistic sense. As &ldquo;predigested&rdquo; food,
such dishes are decided preferable to the &ldquo;<i>grosses-pi&egrave;ces</i>,&rdquo;
which besides energetic mastication require
skillful manipulation of fork and knife;
such exercise was unwelcome on the Roman
couches. Modern nations, featuring &ldquo;<i>grosses-pi&egrave;ces</i>&rdquo;
do this at the expense of high-class cookery.
The word, H., is probably a medieval graecification of INSICIUM.

<p><a name="laser" id="laser"></a>LASER, LASERPITIUM, &mdash;ICIUM, the juice or

as SILPHIUM, SYLPHIUM, Greek, SYLPHION.
Some agree that this is our present asa foetida,
while other authorities deny this. Some claim its
home is in Persia, while others say the best
LASER came from Cyrene (Kyrene), Northern
Africa. The center picture of the so-called Arkesilas-Bowl
of Vulci at Paris, Cab. d. M&eacute;d. 189,
represents a picture as seen by the artist in Kyrene
how King Arkesilas (VI. saec.) watches the
weighing and the stowing away in the hold of a
sailing vessel of a costly cargo of sylphium. It
was an expensive and very much esteemed flavoring
agent, and, for that reason, the plant
which grew only in the wild state, was probably
exterminated</p>

The seeds of this grass were milled, the flour or

deleterious qualities. Apicius, &#8478; <a href="#r50">50</a>, reads LOLAE
FLORIS</p>

<p><a name="longano" id="longano"></a>LONGANO, a blood sausage, &#8478; <a href="#r61">61</a>. The LONGANONES
PORCINOS EX IURE TARENTINO in
&#8478; <a href="#r140">140</a> is a part of the PATINA EX LACTE;
a pork sausage made in Tarent of the straight
gut, the rectum. Lister says they are cooked in
Tarentinian sauce and are not unlike the sausage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
called APEXABO and HILLA. These sausages
were in vogue before the Italians learned to make
them; it was in Epirus, Greece, that they were
highly developed. Their importation into Rome
caused quite a stir, politically. Lister, &#8478; 50, p.
119, describes the sausage and calls the inhabitants
of Tarent &ldquo;most voluptuous, soft and delicate&rdquo;
because Juvenal, Sat. VI, v. 297, takes a
shot at Tarent</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>This part of Italy, and especially Sicily, because

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>MALUM, fruit, an apple, but quinces, pomegranates,
peaches, oranges, lemons, and other
fruits were likewise designated by this name.
&#8478; <a href="#r21">18</a>, <a href="#r20">20</a>. See also <a href="#citrum">CITRUM</a></p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>It is remarkable that Apicius does not specifically
speak of lemons and oranges, fruits that
must have grown in Italy at his time, that are so
indispensable to modern cookery</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>MALUM PUNICUM, &#8478; <a href="#r20">20</a>,

<a href="#r171">171</a>. This
name, which according to Schuch simply stands
for a rose-colored apple, has led to the belief
that the ancients made pies, etc., of roses. Today
a certain red-colored apple is known as
&ldquo;Roman Beauty.&rdquo; We concur in Schuch&rsquo;s opinion,
remembering, however, that the fruit of the
rose tree, namely the hip, dog-briar, or eglantine,
is made into dainty confections on the Continent
today. It is therefore quite possible that MALUM
ROSEUM stands for the fruit of the rose</p>

<p>MANDUCO, to chew, to munch, to enjoy food by
munching; a glutton</p>

<p><a name="mappa" id="mappa"></a>MAPPA, table napkin (Fr. nappe). M. is a Punic
word, according to Quintil. 1, 5, 57</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>Each banquet guest brought with him from
his own home such a napkin or cloth which he
used during the banquet to wipe his mouth and
hands. The ancients, evidently, were conscious
of the danger of infection through the common
use of napkins and table ware. Sometimes they
used their napkins to wrap up part of the meal
and to give it to their slaves to carry home in.
Horace, Martial, Petronius attest to this fact. The
banquet guests also employed their own slaves
to wait on them at their Host&rsquo;s party. This custom
and the individual napkin habit have survived
until after the French revolution. Grimod
de la Reyni&egrave;re, in his Almanach des Gourmands,
Paris, 1803, seq., describes how guests furnished
their own napkins and servants for their own
use at parties to which they were invited</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>This rather sensible custom relieved the host
of much responsibility and greatly assisted him
in defraying the expenses of the dinner. On the
other hand it reveals the restrictions placed upon
any host by the general shortage of table ware,
table linen, laundering facilities in the days prior
to the mechanical age</p>

<p><a name="ranae" id="ranae"></a>RANAE, frogs, have been an article of diet for
ages. Platina gives fine directions for their preparation.
He recommends only frogs living in the
water. RUBETAS ET SUB TERRA VIVENTES,
UT NOXIAS REJICIO! AQUATILAS HAE
SUNT DE QUIBUS LOQUOR</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>Platina skins the frogs, turns them in flour
and fries them in oil; he adds fennel flower
garnish and SALSA VIRIDA (green sauce, our
ravigote or remoulade) on the side. No modern
chef could do different or improve upon it.
The fennel blossom garnish is a startling stroke
of genius</p>

used by Platina who says: &ldquo;RISUM, QUOD EGO
ANTIQUO VOCABULO ORIZAM APPELLATUM
PUTO.&rdquo; This is one of the many philologically
interesting instances found in Platina
and Aegineta of the evolution of a term from
the antique to the medieval Latin and finally
emerging into modern Italian. What better proof,
if necessary, could be desired than this etymology
for the authenticity of the Apicius book? Its
age could be proven by a philologist if no other
proof were at hand</p>

<p><a name="sturnus" id="sturnus"></a>STURNUS, a starling, stare; Platina condemns its
meat as unfit, likewise that of the blackbird
(cf. <a href="#merula">MERULA</a>); he pronounces their flesh to be
&ldquo;devilish.&rdquo; &ldquo;STURNI, QUOS VULGO DIABOLICAM
CARNEM HABERE DICIMUS.&rdquo; Yet
three-hundred years later, French authorities recommend
this sort of food. Viger, La Nouvelle
Maison Rustique, Paris, 1798, Vol. iii, p. 613,
tells how to catch and fatten STURNI. &ldquo;After
a month [of forced feeding] they will be nice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and fat and good to eat and to sell; there are
persons who live of this trade.&rdquo; He praises the
crow similarly</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>These instances are cited not only as a commentary
upon the taste of the Southern people
and their habits which have endured to this day
but also to illustrate the singular genius of
Platina. Also the following notes to <a href="#styrio">STYRIO</a> tend
to show how far advanced was Platina in the
matter of food as compared with the masters of
the 18th century in France</p>

<p><a name="styrio" id="styrio"></a>STYRIO, STIRIO, STURIO, &#8478; <a href="#r145">145</a>, sturgeon;
probably the same fish as known to the ancients
as ACIPENSER or STURIO. (A. SIVE S. OBLONGO
TEREDEQUE&mdash;Stephanus &agrave; Schonevelde,
in Ichthyologia, Hamburg, 1624). There
can be no doubt that the sturgeon or sterlet is
meant by this term, for Platina calls the eggs of
the fish &ldquo;caviare.&rdquo; &ldquo;OVA STIRIONIS CONDITUM
QUOD CAUARE UOCANT.&rdquo; Eloquently
he describes his struggle with the changing
language. The efforts of this conscientious
man, Platina, to get at the bottom of things no
matter how trivial they may appear, are highly
praiseworthy</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>He writes &ldquo;DE STIRIONE. TRAHI PER
TENEBRAS N&#362;C MIHI VIDEOR, QUANDO
HOR&#362;, DE QUIBUS, DEINCEPS DICTURUS
SUM, PISCI&#362;, NULLUS CERTUS UEL NOMINIS,
UEL NATURAE EXISTAT AUTOR.
NEGLIGENTIAE MAIORUM &amp; INSCITIAE ID
MAGIS, QU&Agrave;M MIHI ASCRIBENDUM EST.
VTAR EGO NOUIS NOMINIBUS NE DELICATORUM
GULAE PER ME DICANT STETISSE,
QUO MINUS INTEGRA
UTERENTUR UOLUPTATE.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>As for the rest, Platina cooks the sturgeon precisely
in our own modern way: namely in water,
white wine and vinegar. And: &ldquo;SALEM INDERE
MEMENTO!&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget the salt!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>Compare him with France 350 years later. As
for caviare, A. Beauvilliers, in his L&rsquo;Art du
cuisinier, Paris, 1814, treats this &ldquo;rago&ucirc;t&rdquo; as
something entirely new; yet Beauvilliers was the
leading restaurateur of his time and a very capable
cook, save Car&ecirc;me, the best. Beauvilliers
has no use for caviare which he calls &ldquo;Kavia.&rdquo;
Says he: &ldquo;LES RUSSES EN FONT UN GRAND
CAS ET L&rsquo;ACHETENT FORT CHER [The Russians
make a big thing of this and buy it very
dearly] CE RAGOUT, SELON MOI, NE CONVIENT
QU&rsquo; AUX RUSSES&mdash;this stew, according
to my notion, suits only the Russians
or those who have traveled thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>Shakespeare, in speaking about &ldquo;Caviare to the
General&rdquo; apparently was more up-to-date in culinary
matters than this Parisian authority. A
search of the eight volumes (Vol. I, 1803) of
the famous Almanach des Gourmands by Grimod
de la Reyni&egrave;re, Paris, 1803, seq., fails to reveal
a trace of caviare</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>A German cook, a hundred years after Platina,
Marx Rumpolt in &ldquo;Ein new Kochbuch,
Franckfort am Mayn, bey Johan Feyrabendt,
1587&rdquo; on verso of folio XCVII, No. 9, gives an
exact description of caviare and its mode of
preparation. He calls it ROGEN VOM HAUSEN.
The HAUSEN is the real large sturgeon, the
Russian Beluga from which the best caviare is
obtained. Rumpolt, whose book is the finest and
most thorough of its kind in the middle ages, and
a great work in every respect, remarks that
caviare is good eating, especially for Hungarian
gentlemen</p>

of wine. Then there are the names of
the different brands coming from different parts,
too numerous to mention. Furthermore there are
wines of grapes, old and new, plain or distilled,
raw or cooked, pure and diluted, natural or flavored,
and the many different drinks made of
grape wine with herbs and spices</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>V. NIGRUM, &ldquo;black wine,&rdquo; may be muddy
wine in need of clarification; there is some slight
doubt about this point. It appears that the vintner
of old was much more tempted to foist unworthy
stuff upon his customers than his colleague
of today who is very much restricted by
law and guided by his reputation</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>VINUM also is any drink or liquor resembling
grape wine, any home-made wine fermented or
fresh. There is a V. EX NAPIS, &mdash;&mdash; PALMEUM, &mdash;&mdash;
EX CAROTIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX MILII SEMINE, &mdash;&mdash; EX
LOTO, &mdash;&mdash; EX FICO, &mdash;&mdash; EX PUNCICIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX
CORNIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX MESPILIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX SORBIS, &mdash;&mdash;
EX MORIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX NUCLEIS PINEIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX
PIRIS, &mdash;&mdash; EX MALIS, (cf. <a href="#pliny">Pliny</a>), resembling
our cider, perry, berry wines and other drink or
liquor made of fruit, berries, vegetables or seeds</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>VIOLATIUM and ROSATIUM, &#8478; <a href="#r5">5</a>, are
laxatives; &mdash;&mdash; ORIGANUM is wine flavored with
origany; etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="indent">&nbsp;</span>It is doubtful, however, that the Romans knew
the art of distillation to the extent as perfected
by the Arabs centuries later and brought to higher
perfection by the medical men and alchymists
of the middle ages</p>

<p>[Through the good offices of Dr. Edwardt Brandt, of
Munich, the above two commentaries on Apicius were
received in the last moment, thanks to the courtesy of
the author, Lekto J. Svennung, of Uppsala, Sweden. The
first study is a critique of technical terms and
colloquialisms as found in Palladius, touching
frequently upon Apicius, published in 1935 at Uppsala by
the Vilhelm Ekman University Foundation and the other is
a reprint of an article on a number of Apician formulae
from Eranos, Vol. XXXIV, published at Gothenburg, 1936,
by Elander, Ltd.</p>

<p>The following have also been noted:</p>

<div class="amends">
<p>The author has consistently used minuscle rather than
minuscule when referring to manuscript. Since it appears
deliberate, it has been preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_9">9</a> has a word obscured&mdash;"one of three known famous
&mdash;&mdash; bearing that name". Another source of the text
has the word as &lsquo;eaters&rsquo;, so the same has been used here.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_23">23</a> has a reference to a "modern" sauce, A I. There
were no obvious references to be found for a sauce of
that name, so it may be a typo for A1 sauce, which was
available at the time of writing. As there is no way to
be certain, however, it has been preserved as printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_49">49</a>&mdash;note to recipe <a href="#r13">13</a> reads, "Exactly as we today
with fried herring and river lamprey". It is possible
that it should read "as we do today", but has been left
as printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_151">151</a>&mdash;recipe <a href="#r241">241</a> has a note 1, but no marker in the
text.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_166">166</a>&mdash;recipe <a href="#r275">275</a> has a marker for note 1, but no
note with that number.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_172">172</a>&mdash;Note 1 to recipe <a href="#r294">294</a> reads "making it convenient
and unprofitable for the domestic cook"&mdash;this should
probably be read as "inconvenient and unprofitable",
but it has been left as printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_175">175</a>&mdash;recipe <a href="#r305">305</a> has a marker for note 2, but no
note with that number.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_189">189</a>&mdash;recipe <a href="#r351">351</a> has a marker for note 2, but no
note with that number.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_211">211</a>&mdash;recipe <a href="#r405a">405a</a> has a marker for note 2, but no
note with that number.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_226">226</a>&mdash;there is no title for recipe <a href="#r445">445</a>.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_230">230</a>&mdash;there is no Latin translation provided for the
heading "EEL".</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_243">243</a>&mdash;recipe <a href="#r481">481</a> is titled "FISH STEWED IN WINE",
but does not mention wine anywhere in the recipe itself.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_284">284</a>&mdash;contained incorrectly placed index entries for
CLIBANUS, CNICOS and CNISSA (following COXA). These have
been moved to the correct place.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_291">291</a>&mdash;the index entry for Morsels also seems to have had the
recipe references (<a href="#r309">309</a>, seq.) for Morels included; this has been preserved as
printed.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_291">291</a>&mdash;contained incorrectly placed index entry for Mullet
(following MUSTUM). This has been moved to the correct place.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_292">292</a>&mdash;in the subentry for OLUS (OLUS AND CAULUS),
there is an &#8478; but no number.</p>
